		<description><![CDATA[I agree that we can tidy up past posts - maybe just a comment to tell it was done?

I also plan to link passenger names to each other in the posts so that you can jump from post to post.

I am vaguely thinking that time is passing very slowly over the weeks - each round of submissions is a tiny bit after the previous? That way it would be possible to continue people&#039;s stories (sitting about to throw up now, throwing up next week, that sort of thing?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice idea this post -have added extra info bits as I imagine we will all maintain this post. 

Given the length of this project and how it might affect the overall product what do you guys think of editing past posts in minor ways in response to comments - types of changes that are reasonable: typos; punctuation; word level changes  without semantic change?

A related but different idea: We should consider a last round after the 24 stories to go back and semantically modify a few of them with the intent of &#039;closing&#039; the internal references?]]></description>
