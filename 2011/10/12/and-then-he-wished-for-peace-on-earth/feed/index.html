		<description><![CDATA[Your TARDIS is forgiven!
Glad to have you on board for another round. :)

Any spread of the words over the weeks and over the wishes is okay, I think.
I&#039;m probably going to go for one wish for 500 words. I feel like something a bit longer for this round. Ahem.

For one a week, you might want to push the limit a little, to 200 words a wish, to give you more room to play.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This seems more challenging to me, and since my project management wasn&#039;t up to sticking to the previous deadline I first have to beg your indulgence of my tardiness, but if you can give a poor sinner another chance I&#039;m interested.
And, to be slow for a while, the maths above implies 166 words per week and 166 words per wish (on average and one to spare), right?]]></description>
