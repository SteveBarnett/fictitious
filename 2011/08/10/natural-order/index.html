						<p>We all saw The Event happen. The half of the world that was asleep woke up, and felt compelled to step outside and tilt our heads back. It was there for just about a second: a sharp green light taking up the whole sky, like a bubble or a dome. Then it was gone. We don&#8217;t know who or what caused it, except that it wasn&#8217;t us. People, I mean. There was some grainy footage of The Event, CCTV cameras and such, but nothing that offered anything new. Nothing that showed us something that we hadn&#8217;t seen that night, standing in the garden in our pajamas, staring open-mouthed up at the sky.</p>
<p>We spent the first week trying to figure out what it was. How did that flash happen? Where did it come from? Why did everyone wake up? Then we became nervous and started asking more: what had it done? We tried to look for any aftereffects of The Event, but the search was too broad; we didn&#8217;t know where to start of what to look for. Did we check us? Or animals? How about crops? What about rocks, soil, the sea? I guess it&#8217;s not surprising that we didn&#8217;t notice for a while: the spread of the effect was too broad. Looking back, I guess I expected someone in a white lab coat, horn rim glasses, and a clipboard to come on the news and tell us about &#8220;A disturbance in The Force&#8221; and what we could do to fix it. Instead, we&#8217;re just around the corner from all these big changes, and we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen to us. To the planet.</p>
<p>It was the little things at first; things that you could explain away, didn&#8217;t take much notice of. Food seemed to go off faster than it should, however you stored it. Ice seemed to melt faster, whatever the temperature of the room. Flavours seemed duller, weaker. Cars stalled in the middle of highways and refused to start again. Computers became less reliable, if they worked at all.</p>
<p>Then we started to notice other, bigger, things. Things that you thought were a trick of the eye. The moon looked smaller. Measurements were taken, experts consulted. A space shuttle was pulled out of retirement and sent up to confirm: the moon was moving away from us.</p>
<p>We became obsessed with measuring things, checking for changes. What else was happening? We found that the Earth&#8217;s spin was slowing. Days had become longer since The Event. Years had become longer. The wobble, Earth&#8217;s tilt on its axis, had increased. Things that should be taking millions of years were happening in months, and the rate of decay was increasing exponentially. &#8220;Everything is going to shit,&#8221; I think was the official line from the President&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>No-one knows quite what will happen in the next few weeks. The messed up days and tides have broken the food chain. Fresh food is scarce. Even the tinned goods are spilling out of their rusty containers. Maybe we won&#8217;t live to see what happens when the moon finally breaks free of its orbit. Maybe we&#8217;ll be hallucinating from hunger when the Earth stops spinning. Maybe our bones will be crumbling when the Earth tilts all the way over.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;ll be another green flash in the sky and it will all be over.</p>

			<div class="comment-body"><p>Really liked the idea, the nature of time changing in this way &#8211; original and very creepy.</p>
<p>I found the loose switching between past and present tense difficulty &#8211; not confusing, just flow breaking. Repetition of &#8216;too broad&#8217; in the first paragraph worried me some as well.</p>
<p>Really loved the confused, unhappy ending &#8211; the sheer uncertainty is a lovely opening ending.</p>

			<div class="comment-body"><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I (like Jo and maybe you) struggled with this Project, even though I suggested it.<br />
I haven&#8217;t read an entropy-based apocalypse story before, and I like to think that it is at least a little bit original.</p>
<p>Too broad repetition: an oversight, should have spotted it.</p>
<p>Re tense: I see your point. I&#8217;m wondering if present tense might have been better for the story as a whole.</p>
<p>Re ending: thanks! I felt like a dark, sad, ending.</p>

			<div class="comment-body"><p>I loved the idea of this &#8211; the scary thought of the world just breaking up, losing its flavour (it reminded me of Stephen King&#8217;s Langolliers in this respect &#8211; but that is not an end of the world story.</p>
<p>Agree about the tense &#8211; switching &#8211; I think past tense throughout with just the last paragraph in present tense would be better (the whole thing in present tense would be weird).</p>
<p>Line by line nitpicks (as I&#8217;m feeling frisky):<br />
&#8220;We all saw The Event happen.&#8221; &#8211; small T?<br />
&#8220;The half of the world that was asleep woke up, and felt compelled to step outside and tilt our heads back.&#8221; &#8211; slightly confused ownership of heads: &#8220;The half of the world that was asleep woke up. We all felt compelled to step outside and tilt our heads back&#8221;?<br />
&#8220;&#8230;standing in the garden in our pajamas&#8221;, &#8211; again the our is confusing (humanity? you and your family?) I would go with &#8220;standing in our gardens in pajamas&#8221;<br />
&#8220;aftereffects&#8221; &#8211; after-effects?<br />
&#8220;Did we check us?&#8221; &#8211; this is a little hard to parse<br />
&#8220;It was the little things &#8230;   if they worked at all.&#8221; &#8211; this whole paragraph is great, gives a real flavour to the dulling of the world.</p>
<p>&#8221; Years had become longer.&#8221; &#8211; this is also cool. I like the idea of everyone getting tired as days and hours get longer, but no one notices as clocks slow.<br />
&#8220;“Everything is going to shit,” I think was the official line from the President’s office.&#8221; &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t work for me, I can&#8217;t see that announcement happening so it breaks the flow for me.</p>
<p>Great story, depressing and disturbing.</p>
