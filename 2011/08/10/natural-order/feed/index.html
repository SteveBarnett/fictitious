		<description><![CDATA[I loved the idea of this - the scary thought of the world just breaking up, losing its flavour (it reminded me of Stephen King&#039;s Langolliers in this respect - but that is not an end of the world story.

Agree about the tense - switching - I think past tense throughout with just the last paragraph in present tense would be better (the whole thing in present tense would be weird).

Line by line nitpicks (as I&#039;m feeling frisky):
&quot;We all saw The Event happen.&quot; - small T?
&quot;The half of the world that was asleep woke up, and felt compelled to step outside and tilt our heads back.&quot; - slightly confused ownership of heads: &quot;The half of the world that was asleep woke up. We all felt compelled to step outside and tilt our heads back&quot;?
&quot;...standing in the garden in our pajamas&quot;, - again the our is confusing (humanity? you and your family?) I would go with &quot;standing in our gardens in pajamas&quot;
&quot;aftereffects&quot; - after-effects?
&quot;Did we check us?&quot; - this is a little hard to parse
&quot;It was the little things ...   if they worked at all.&quot; - this whole paragraph is great, gives a real flavour to the dulling of the world.

&quot; Years had become longer.&quot; - this is also cool. I like the idea of everyone getting tired as days and hours get longer, but no one notices as clocks slow. 
&quot;“Everything is going to shit,” I think was the official line from the President’s office.&quot; - this doesn&#039;t work for me, I can&#039;t see that announcement happening so it breaks the flow for me.

Great story, depressing and disturbing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!

I (like Jo and maybe you) struggled with this Project, even though I suggested it.
I haven&#039;t read an entropy-based apocalypse story before, and I like to think that it is at least a little bit original.

Too broad repetition: an oversight, should have spotted it.

Re tense: I see your point. I&#039;m wondering if present tense might have been better for the story as a whole.

Re ending: thanks! I felt like a dark, sad, ending.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really liked the idea, the nature of time changing in this way - original and very creepy.

I found the loose switching between past and present tense difficulty - not confusing, just flow breaking. Repetition of &#039;too broad&#039; in the first paragraph worried me some as well.

Really loved the confused, unhappy ending - the sheer uncertainty is a lovely opening ending.]]></description>
