						<p>My mother was a throwback, a person from a different time &#8211; the final rebel in humanity&#8217;s smallest generation. They all made her pay for it of course: most with ostracism, but some with their compassionate understanding of her moral weakness. After her suicide they told me to rejoice that she had finally found moral clarity.</p>
<p>I was alone after that. But I had always been the only child: I was used to being alone.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just my mother’s pro-humanist beliefs that were anachronistic, almost all her out-time was spent researching the twenty-first century: text works , flatties, old reality-stores, music  and whatever other junk she could lay her hands on. I grew up with that stuff all around; and I have to tell you: those pre-rational folk were obsessed with their own deaths.</p>
<p>Any disaster imaginable was played out in their fiction: nuclear war, biological agents, the sun going super nova, rising sea levels, catastrophic climate change, monsters from the deep and alien invaders. I spent my childhood watching those ancient flatties, disaster films they called them. Their far-fetched dooms were so romantic, their heroes so brave in the face of annihilation.</p>
<p>But they never imagined the truth, not a single surviving work of fiction from their time predicts the Restoration Movement. Until recently I had assumed the idea of voluntary extinction was completely beyond their moral reach, but I found an old store in my mother’s stuff: a semantically indexed copy of their &#8216;internet&#8217; (a PubStorage precursor). I learnt a few things. I read about those at Masada who chose death out of principle a thousand years before. I read first of their suicide cults and later of death cults and I realised it was more than just their fiction, they felt it in their hearts &#8211; already they wished for the peace of absence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I also found VHEMT, the ‘Voluntary Human Extinction Movement’, founded in the late twentieth century. I suppose it was a kind of joke, an idea more than anything else, intended to be thought provoking, certainly not world changing.  Its authors may not have taken it seriously but they understood the first question of the Restoration, &#8220;Would it be better if we weren&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they were the first to look with rational eyes and answer: &#8220;Yes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was two centuries before those ideas really took hold: the culture of parenting ran. It’s hard to remember that in the beginning the Restorationists were the freaks, their ideas threatening, and the breeders were the vast amoral majority. For years even non-violent Restorationist groups were persecuted but the truth of their basic beliefs couldn’t be repressed. Humanity had lifted its gaze above mere survival and found a greater measure against which to judge its actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After forests and the wolves had returned to Europe it was easier – we had caught a glimpse of the post-restoration world and in it we had seen absolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the youngest of the last generation and our species will end not like an old flattie: there will be no screaming terror; no heroic last stand; nor any outpost of hopeful survivors. We will leave this place in the quiet knowledge that in our final wisdom we have striven to be better than we might have been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

and like the &#8220;flatties&#8221; (although it feels weird to type that).<br />
Bringing in VHEMT (which I did not know of before) was also a nice touch.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the picture you painted of the quiet dignity of being part of the Restoration, compared to present-day spluttering and breeding.</p>
<p>Kind of cold and restrained: me like!</p>

			<div class="comment-body"><p>Yes, definitely an original extinction tale. I enjoyed the voice &#8211; an involved narrator, the last child of earth. The slightly future-slangy language worked well to set the scene.</p>
<p>I would have liked to see the mother-theme carried through &#8211; the story starts off about her and her unusual choice and her being ostracised, but the suicide ending deprives us of the opportunity to follow the story of her death in tandem with the species&#8217; demise. </p>
<p>A bunch of small comments: </p>
<p>&#8220;the final rebel in humanity’s smallest generation&#8221; nice start!</p>
<p>&#8220;I grew up with that stuff all around; and I have to tell you: those pre-rational folk were obsessed with their own deaths.&#8221; I would have put a full stop instead of the semi-colon &#8211; it looks odd to me with the colon following the semicolon.<br />
&#8220;&#8230; catastrophic climate change, monsters from the deep and alien invaders.&#8221; Might work better without the &#8220;and&#8221; &#8211; implies the list goes on. </p>
<p>&#8220;But they never imagined the truth, not a single surviving work of fiction from their time predicts the Restoration Movement.&#8221; Again, a full stop instead of the comma may pace this better. </p>
<p>&#8220;And they were the first to look with rational eyes and answer: “Yes.”&#8221; not sure I follow this.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the culture of parenting ran.&#8221; I don&#8217;t understand this?<br />
&#8220;For years even non-violent Restorationist groups were persecuted but the truth of their basic beliefs couldn’t be repressed.&#8221; Comma before &#8220;but&#8221;?  </p>
<p>&#8220;I am the youngest of the last generation and our species will end not like an old flattie: there will be no screaming terror; no heroic last stand; nor any outpost of hopeful survivors.&#8221; I would break this up a lot more:  &#8220;I am the youngest of the last generation. Our species will end not like an old flattie: there will be no screaming terror, no heroic last stand, no outpost of hopeful survivors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will leave this place in the quiet knowledge that in our final wisdom we have striven to be better than we might have been.&#8221; This feels a little overlong and clumsy. I have no easy fix, but I would rethink this one.</p>
<p>500 word stories make for looong comments if one wants to nitpick on punctuation&#8230; the comments are actually quite minor and I enjoyed the story and the idea a lot. </p>
<p>PS. What&#8217;s with the weird spacing?</p>
