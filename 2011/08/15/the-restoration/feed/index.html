		<description><![CDATA[Yes, definitely an original extinction tale. I enjoyed the voice - an involved narrator, the last child of earth. The slightly future-slangy language worked well to set the scene.

I would have liked to see the mother-theme carried through - the story starts off about her and her unusual choice and her being ostracised, but the suicide ending deprives us of the opportunity to follow the story of her death in tandem with the species&#039; demise. 

A bunch of small comments: 

&quot;the final rebel in humanity’s smallest generation&quot; nice start!

&quot;I grew up with that stuff all around; and I have to tell you: those pre-rational folk were obsessed with their own deaths.&quot; I would have put a full stop instead of the semi-colon - it looks odd to me with the colon following the semicolon.
&quot;... catastrophic climate change, monsters from the deep and alien invaders.&quot; Might work better without the &quot;and&quot; - implies the list goes on. 

&quot;But they never imagined the truth, not a single surviving work of fiction from their time predicts the Restoration Movement.&quot; Again, a full stop instead of the comma may pace this better. 

&quot;And they were the first to look with rational eyes and answer: “Yes.”&quot; not sure I follow this.

&quot;...the culture of parenting ran.&quot; I don&#039;t understand this?
&quot;For years even non-violent Restorationist groups were persecuted but the truth of their basic beliefs couldn’t be repressed.&quot; Comma before &quot;but&quot;?  

&quot;I am the youngest of the last generation and our species will end not like an old flattie: there will be no screaming terror; no heroic last stand; nor any outpost of hopeful survivors.&quot; I would break this up a lot more:  &quot;I am the youngest of the last generation. Our species will end not like an old flattie: there will be no screaming terror, no heroic last stand, no outpost of hopeful survivors.&quot;

&quot;We will leave this place in the quiet knowledge that in our final wisdom we have striven to be better than we might have been.&quot; This feels a little overlong and clumsy. I have no easy fix, but I would rethink this one.

500 word stories make for looong comments if one wants to nitpick on punctuation... the comments are actually quite minor and I enjoyed the story and the idea a lot. 

PS. What&#039;s with the weird spacing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dig the meta-recursiveness of
&gt; Any disaster imaginable was played out in their fiction
and like the &quot;flatties&quot; (although it feels weird to type that).
Bringing in VHEMT (which I did not know of before) was also a nice touch.

I enjoyed the picture you painted of the quiet dignity of being part of the Restoration, compared to present-day spluttering and breeding.

Kind of cold and restrained: me like!]]></description>
