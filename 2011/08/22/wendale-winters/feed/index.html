		<description><![CDATA[This is great and intense. I enjoyed the uber-focus on the button in the first section (I look forward to hearing from the button and tie guy in a future iteration), it is appropriately detailed and frozen in time.

I would have dumped &quot;calm distraction instead&quot; from the second paragraph, and put a comma after Kinetosis. Does one normally capitalise diseases? I&#039;m not sure...

So so far we have an insane guy, a super-tense prude and a guy about to throw up. Great stuff! Bring on round 2 :)

I note the train has toilets, so it&#039;s not the tube. I&#039;m interested to see where we are going....]]></description>
