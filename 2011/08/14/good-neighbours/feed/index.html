		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this. I think the build up and reveal of the crime work well. I like the way the the story only makes sense because the reader understands how humans are - the &#039;give the primate the tools and he&#039;ll inevitably break everything&#039; message is cute.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool!
Nice, slightly sneaky, build up to the reveal, and a pretty new take of destruction of the planet. I enjoyed the difference in scales: end of the (Earthling) world vs another day in court.

Minor quibble: I&#039;m not sure that the initials worked for me. I might have preferred names or surnames for the line labels. I found it a little hard to follow exactly who was speaking after a dozen lines or so. Perhaps I am thick, though.

A fun read, and a nice jab at intergalatic estate agents. Groovy!]]></description>
