		<description><![CDATA[Thank you - when I wrote the first one (the drawing room) I was under the impression that we would all be collaborating on the keywords, so I quite carefully did not have a story in mind.

It is all so horrible and proper - and sad. Like the way from the very first drawing room comment you lead to the sofa at the end (and beginning) of the story.

&#039;it&#039;s surface clear except for that one elegant volume&#039; - is so cool and emotive.]]></description>
