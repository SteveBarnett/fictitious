		<description><![CDATA[Deliciously creepy! All these hints and outright glimpses of wrongness hiding everywhere. I very much liked the unusual ways the place was... well, unusual - the smell of the sea, the sticky tables, the strange mantelpiece. Delightful and unexpected! The language leaps off the page - &quot;the smell of meat before it turns&quot;, &quot;listed towards each other like drunkards&quot;, &quot;cleaned up in a hurry upon hearing the doorbell&quot;. Unusual and evocative. The atmosphere just teams with soupy horror.

Things that did not quite work for me - the haberdashery, the occult symbols, perhaps the claw marks too. A little more obvious than the more unexpected other signs. But this is a minor quib. Great story!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So creepy - loved the way this rather innocent paragraph ended up so full of foreboding.  Enjoyed the way the first few entries get increasingly ugly and like how it never becomes too explicitly weird.

My favourite bits: &#039;the smell would stay on my shoes for days afterwards&#039; and &#039;that dark patch...&#039;]]></description>
