		<description><![CDATA[I had originally intended to be explicit about the homosexuality (and it my mind it is the most likely &#039;thing about yourself that your parents don&#039;t know&#039;) but in the end I wanted to push the idea of an unreasonable (unnatural?) rejection of a family member.

The idea of portraying a suburban-polite well to do  family with out much warmth or compassion as brittle and quite horrible was at the heart of it - so atmosphere and imagery came first and the &#039;rejected&#039; narrative  seemed complimentary.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This crept up on me - seemingly unrelated stories of the living room flotsam and jetsam, but they slowly come together. Somehow I had understood that the brother had left under a cloud, (I suspect he is gay), before I even read the Victorian Sofa paragraph. 

Subtle and meandering, it&#039;s lovely. The only one that does not work as part of the story from my point of view is the needlework pictures - they somehow don&#039;t hang together with the rest. 

Did you have a narrative in mind from the start or did it develop from the images? A lot of the imagery is a reflection of the family - chipped, dirty in the cracks, yearning for former glory, empty. That subtext works well for me.]]></description>
