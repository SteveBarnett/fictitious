I wanted to get a bit of a balance between homage and straight rip-off. Think I did okay ;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Enjoyed how close you stuck to P&#039;s original. Very similar in structure and outlook. I felt like your version was somewhat lighter ad tongue in cheek.

Enjoyed the changed ending, especially the pace and simplicity of it; nice change after the going on-ness on the rest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!

My initial, don&#039;t think it through too much, idea was just to write something from all the other viewpoints. Obviously that doesn&#039;t quite work for mad scientist and cop!

I liked the idea of saving the world for once, but I liked your language and turns of phrase. So I stole them and moved them around :).

Past tense and typos: argh, yes. Will fix at some point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the remix! It&#039;s really cool - the paragraphs mimic each other, but viewpoints shift. It&#039;s very clever. I love that yours has a happy ending too - mixing up the paragraphs works very well there. I particularly like the reworking of the &quot;cop&quot; paragraph - down to the same sentences in a different order, it really develops the different message in a clever way.

Nitpicks: the past tense in the second paragraph doesn&#039;t work  - probably an oversight since the rest is in present tense? 

&quot;All&#039;s the machine lights&quot; - All the machine&#039;s lights?

Minor!

And Middleman reference duly noted ;)]]></description>
