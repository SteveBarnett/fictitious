		<description><![CDATA[Love the change of view. Whereas mine is obviously leading towards something bad is an ongoingly less funny way, your if upfront about what the cat is seeking and all makes a driven sense.

I love your interpretation of the normal objects and the wordplay around &#039;useful&#039;.

Also enjoyed that you preserved the mystery of my story (where the hell did the cat find this shit) but treated it as obvious - instead shifting the tease onto what exactly the cat needs to do to get back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Icky. I like it!

Lovely spins on the everyday(ish) objects from the origins, story. Very cool to see the other side of the story and realize that (unbelievably) it&#039;s even more creepy than you thought.

I feel a little like it was a bit of a cheat to combine a remix of a story with a world from another, but your fairyland is too charming to resist. Want more!]]></description>
