		<description><![CDATA[Lovely! But disturbing and gross. :)

You&#039;ve captured the voice really well and your remixed story is really engaging.

The only part that didn&#039;t quite scan for me was:
&gt; (and it’s a good one)
Somehow feels a little too modern / human slang compared to the fey, odd, otherworldly perceptionness of the rest.

The rotting kelp, the wing mirror sequence, the two starling chicks - brilliant!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I take this dark tale as a very twisted complement to my innocent one! 

This is glorious in its grimy awfulness, particularly if read as a rural/urban, present/past perversion of the fairies. But that&#039;s not the only way to read it - it works equally well as different expressions of magic, one of which is tainted because of the reader&#039;s naive preconceptions - but to the protagonists, just as magical as the original version. The bloody, carnivorous nature of the fairies (or whatever they are) can be read the same - are they now evil, or monstrous, or is it because they are no longer conforming to our ideals and morals that we see them that way?

This was visceral fun. I liked the scraping of the ash and the broken chicks, and the image of being wrapped in smoke is powerful and beautiful. Clinging to the mirror screaming lust and joy also really works for me.

Nitpicks: The description of &quot;things getting hairy&quot; with the driver doesn&#039;t quite work - maybe it&#039;s because the world is quite devoid of metaphor otherwise - everything else is literally described. 

Soft stuffing of AN old sofa.

Thanks - it&#039;s a much braver tale than mine!

PS. I made, without intending to, a similar play of rewriting the fairy world onto our world with my contribution - an interesting pair!]]></description>
