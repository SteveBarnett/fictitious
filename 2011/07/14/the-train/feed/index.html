		<description><![CDATA[Sounds groovy to me. One a week each, short and sharp.

I&#039;ve added this Post to a new Category: Active &gt; 2011-08-15 to 2011-10-09.

A map would be cool. Will you draw it? :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m quite keen on the 1 week rotation, especially since we have only done 2 weekly cycles, and i tend to basically do very little the first week... (or nothing, could be nothing)

Let&#039;s make it quite short though - 100 - 200 words per character. If it&#039;s 3 of us, we could do 24 characters - 8 each? We can do submissions from all of us each week, so we&#039;d be done in 8 weeks. Does this make sense?

If more people join, 24 divides nicely by 3-4-6-8 :)

Should we have a visual guide, say a map of the carriage with character numbers?

I&#039;d like to talk to you about the layout of the site - I would like to have the current project description more prominent, and displays organised by topic - a more newspaper format? Can we fiddle? :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jo, can you confirm final thoughts on timing, please?

Should we maybe do one a fortnight, writing concurrently, so that no-one has a quiet patch?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed 253 (although maybe some little lacks in the story were made up for by the unusual form), and I&#039;d like to try my hand at the linky goodness of this.

How about after a few short / easy ones?]]></description>
