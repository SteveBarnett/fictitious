				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Hello, my name is Winnifred.”<br />
The train rocks forward, backward. Soothing.<br />
“Winnifred Jenkins.“<br />
There’s a bit of a commotion, now.<br />
“People call me Winnie.”<br />
Why is everyone shouting?<br />
“I’ve always wanted to work for Arcadia Inc.”<br />
There is definitely some sort of situation now. With Kung Fu. Or something.<br />
“I’m sorry I’m late. Some trouble on the train.”<br />
Is that a dagger? Why are those symbols glowing?<br />
“No, nothing serious, not really&#8230;”<br />
Blood. Blood everywhere.<br />
“Excuse the stains. Like I said, a little trouble&#8230;”<br />
Does no one hear her speak the killing words?<br />
“No, of course I don’t need to see a doctor.”<br />
Does no one see the man in grey, the man with the dead eyes?<br />
“Most of the blood isn’t even mine&#8230;”<br />
He reaches into the black torrent of her curse, he reaches into her black heart.<br />
“I would have rather died than missed this opportunity&#8230;”<br />
He turns her inside out, he folds her up. She’s gone.<br />
“It was nothing, really.”<br />
His icy hand reaches inside me, inside everyone.<br />
“I guess I keep cool in a crisis.”<br />
I give him my memory. I give it willingly.<br />
“I&#8217;ve already forgotten all about it. Let&#8217;s talk about the job, shall we?&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why would these two ordinary teenagers be concealing bright red top-hats in their school bags? Why did they bunk class to research a band from a different era? Why did they choose to sit with the man dressed as a Walrus and the mother with the red hippy skirt and the Lennon spectacles?  Why are they listening so intently to the audio-stream from their phones?</p>
<p>It started last night, in Toronto, on the streamed version of CHUM Rock Radio. The DJ felt strongly about the Rolling Stones cover story: “The Stupidest Song of All Time?”  He felt the playful inanity of the Beatle’s “I am the Walrus” should be celebrated not mocked. By the end of the show he had two hundred locals signed up to dress-up Beatle’s style and sing it live at their studios the next day.</p>
<p>Three hours later, when #iamthewalrussingalong started trending, it had become clear no one wanted to be left out. The meme had taken hold: pictures of people cutting their hair and sewing outfits flooded the net, planning and meet-up threads were created, techies stayed late to beef up the streaming-proxies.</p>
<p>Even now the DJ seemed over-awed at his creation: “There must be a thousand people in our building right now, the crowd is really excited and the outfits amazing. I’m looking at a webcam in St Petersburg, seems those Russian Cos-folk have been drinking since sundown. Hope those of you out in public are ready for this, we got six minutes to go here&#8230;”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Collie, this is a damned waste of time.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes, Sarge.&#8221; No, Sarge, damn it, Sarge.<br />
&#8220;That was one hysterical broad, lad. Those tips have a way of not panning out.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;If you say so, Sarge.&#8221; You know what you are, Sarge. A Little City Policeman, sitting in his row. Like she said, now I think about it. Ten years on the force and you&#8217;re nowhere, &#8216;sarge&#8217;, and you know why? Because you&#8217;re one lazy bastard. One lazy, witless -<br />
&#8220;Say, Collie, isn&#8217;t that our friend <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/fictitious.co.za/2011/08/21/sir-reginald/">Reggie</a>? Drunk as life and bothering the passengers, wouldn&#8217;t you say? Let&#8217;s do these nice people a favour and escort his royal Reggieness off this train, what do you say, Collie? Hey?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes. Sarge. Sure thing.&#8221; Sure thing, Sarge, let&#8217;s ignore the tip off about a mad bomber on this train, let&#8217;s just leave all these people to die horribly, Sarge. We&#8217;ll have saved them from the drunk though, right, Sarge? Might get a commendation for that, oh yes.<br />
&#8220;Crazy tip, anyway. Singing that nonsense Beatles tune. Lady may have had a drink or two herself, Collie, hey? Collie? What on earth are you staring at over there? Collie?&#8221;<br />
I am the <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/fictitious.co.za/2011/08/25/walter-millian/">walrus</a>. Coo fucking choo.</p>
