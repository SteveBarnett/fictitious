				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I open my eyes and it feels different. It feels dreamy. When I try and concentrate, I realise that I don&#8217;t remember how it felt before. But I think it was sharper. I think  it feels softer now. More relaxed. Slower.</p>
<p>I try to stand up, but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I try to move my legs, but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I look down at my hands, crossed on my lap, and see a tiny dial. Like a timer on an old rehydrator. The arrow points to red. Red what? It has two more notches: green and blue. Green and blue what? I turn the dial one notch to green.</p>
<p>I try to scream, but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I taste metal. I feel suddenly cold. I can see the edges of the room now, but I wish I couldn&#8217;t. The walls glitch and distort. I feel like I&#8217;m going to vomit. I look down at my wrist to turn the dial, but it&#8217;s gone. It was right there.</p>
<p>I look up at the ceiling, hoping for a calmer sight than the walls, but it&#8217;s worse. It&#8217;s cracked and melted and shattered, and it oozes slowly towards me. I turn my head away and see the dial. My other hand. How did it move? I crank the dial to blue.</p>
<p>Clear.<br />
Crystal.<br />
Light.</p>
<p>I feel at peace.<br />
Everything starts to desaturate, to darken.<br />
But I feel at peace, and I welcome it.</p>
<p>Colour to grey to black.</p>

My mind quietly drifts to the smooth thrum of the wheels; at 400km/h the french countryside is a pleasant green blur through the window of the TGV. My eyelids begin to droop.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Something is being dragged over me and suddenly I’m very cold. I can’t see or move at all but I’m not afraid. I feel calm, objective. The voices seem tense, business like, strained &#8211; after a long time I realise that I can’t understand them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Etat bleu,etat bleu, etat bleu&#8230;”, a clear woman’s voice from nearby, tired almost bored sounding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Etat rouge, il respire , médecin! Etat rouge! Ici!”, much closer now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then I hear frantic activity, a hubbub of foreign voices: all calm, all urgent, all doing something. They sound really stressed, I wonder what could be so important. But whatever their business  it is over soon enough and they rush off. It’s quiet again but still so cold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Etat bleu, etat bleu&#8230;”, that same woman again very close now &#8211; near my feet. A weight is rolled off my right arm. She is so close I can hear her breathing now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dieu ait pitié”, she whispers. And then, louder, “Etat bleu”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Something warm touches me, pulls against my shoulder, almost lifts me. It hurts. I think I scream and that damn woman starts getting all excited again.</p>
