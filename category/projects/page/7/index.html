				<p>His gran had tried her best to teach him the finer details; but somehow he had never mastered the accuracy required to turn needlework into an art form. These were his pride and joy, brimming with his love for the nostalgia of days gone by, though the eclectic colouring was a bit too modern for the themes of the triple ducks flying by. Nobody blamed him for this conceit, since there is always a danger of things going astray if you are colour blind.</p>

				<p>They were a wedding gift from a forgotten relation, placed safely out of reach in the room from which we children were forbidden. In my earliest memories I broke a shepherd&#8217;s crook and mended it with desperate, childish clumsiness.  The inevitable punishment never came &#8211; in all the intervening years the damage was never noticed.</p>
<p>Mother always hated those pale, pastel statues: perhaps that’s why father insisted they always be displayed.</p>

				<p>It had not always been a drawing-room, though a new visitor would never notice this. Madame had ensured the transformation was complete: even the elaborate fireplace and bay window had been torn out and made unrecognisable through the skilful efforts of Mr French and his apprentices. Only the sofa, a Victorian monstrosity without charm or comfort, remained untouched, a jarring reminder of that fateful night. </p>

				<p>The frames at least matched the elegance of the furniture: rich, smooth, wood; crisp lines.<br />
The paintings themselves were a different story. The scenes depicted were easily recognisable as various views from the gardens because the house itself was so striking.<br />
The technique left something to be desired, however. The flat washes were heavy-handed and the wet in wet looked more like accidents than artistic endeavour.</p>

<p>A man walks into a shop in Greenwich and buys the finest clock that he can afford on his modest salary.<br />
It is a gift for his as yet unborn daughter.<br />
Our stories follow the clock as it passes down the generations, being fixed, reboxed, remade.</p>

<p>You find an old lantern in a junk shop one day. You buy it, take it home, polish it up.<br />
Out pops a Genie and offers you three wishes. Your word your requests carefully, so as not to get caught out.<br />
But you do. People always do.</p>
<p>Every few thousand years, the Genie&#8217;s Guild brings together its best and brightest to share stories of Wishers and their Wishes. The best stories, the tales of the most creative and cruel interpretations of a Wish, win the Genie freedom from their lanternic prison. The rest go back to the bottle.</p>
<p>Our job, Fictious folk, is to transcribe the scrolls containing these tales.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 3 weeks.<br />
<strong>Words</strong>: about 500.</p>

<p>Recent years have seen a massive increase in our safety when taking international flights.</p>
<p>Pornoscanners have stopped The Terrorists taking chainsaws onto planes.<br />
Moving our bottles of liquids into zip lock bags has meant that planes have been keep dry enough.<br />
Taking our laptops out of their bags before having them scanned has stopped&#8230; um&#8230; some bad things.<br />
Collectively, this family of measures is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theatre" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">Security Theatre</a>.</p>
<p>I would like to hear Cautionary Tales from the Security Theatre.<br />
Please to writings them.</p>

				<p>Thomas was going through a shoe phase. A year ago it had been vacuum cleaners, but this week it was shoes that engaged his entire attention. He had already spent the greater part of this journey intently examining the workings of the buckle on his mother’s flats – hard, shiny brass against the wrinkled, twisted tan leather strap.</p>
<p>But now he had noticed the shiny black shoes across the carriage, with long, enticing laces neatly tied, on the feet of the man with the animal face. But every time he wondered over his mother would drag him back and give him a hard look: it was very frustrating.</p>
<p>When the weird lady with the tattoos drops something he leaps out, his mother can hardly chide him for being helpful.</p>

				<p>Tonight, she will be devoured by the devil.</p>
<p>She is unable to resist. She feels him, radiating heat, pulsating like a bulge in reality. This is why she is on this train, this is why she needs to bear the erupting teenager, the clumsy slut, the stinking drunk. To catch a devil.</p>
<p>She turns to the blind man beside her like she would to her family confessor. &#8220;Some things are fated, do you understand?&#8221; He nods, turning his sightless eyes towards her. &#8220;But there is honour in trying to resist such fate, isn&#8217;t there?&#8221; he answers. They pretend this talk is about the travelsick young man.</p>
<p>The Comtessa imagines resisting fate. She remembers a blind man&#8217;s meticulous touch, the precision of it. She pretends to have the luxury of choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you&#8221;, she whispers to the blind man. Then she stands up, feeling the weight of her family, her clan, her coven all upon her again. &#8220;Mr Mestopheles, I believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Black eyes burn through her. A cold, perfect hand takes hers.</p>
<p>Tonight, she will be devoured by the devil.</p>

I can feel them all. I&#8217;m connected to them all. I know all their stories. Everyone on the train.</p>
<p>I must find my acolytes. They will help me get back to full strength.<br />

				<p>Every time I decide to do it the world undermines me. All my life people have told me I’m a fighter but that’s obvious to anyone who understands my disease. There are only two kinds of CF sufferers: the fighters and the suicides. This month it was, at last, time to change sides: I have closed my accounts, settled my will and written my eulogy.</p>
<p>But this simple train ride undermines me.</p>
<p>It was that vomiting guy that started it – he actually looked worst than I feel most days – I felt for him. First I was reminded that I’ve never danced on a public train and then that kid came in through the window. He looked so alive; like his head was about to explode with the sheer rush of it. It seems stupid to die without trying that.</p>
<p>Before we reach the station I’m a fighter again.</p>

				<p>That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m going to be late.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this damn train, isn&#8217;t it, this damn so-called public transport &#8220;system&#8221;, ha! A system needs to function to deserve that name.</p>
<p>Enough. I close my eyes and pretend to sleep, but actually I&#8217;m doing my breathing mantra and regulating my heart rate. I&#8217;m getting pretty good at it, I think.</p>
<p>What the heck is going on there, now? I just bloody hope no-one pulls the emergency brake, I would totally lapse my anger management principles on their ass. Oh God, cops? Can this day get any more unbalanced? If I had an aura (I&#8217;m still undecided about that) it would be turning black right now.</p>
<p>Ouch! What the &#8211; is someone shooting or something? That was sore, not like bullet sore, like a kick in the chest sore. What the hell?</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s stopped. A kind woman I had not noticed before comes up to me. &#8220;You look much better now&#8221;, she says, and I do feel better, better than ever. I take her hand.</p>
<p>Behind me, my lifeless head slowly tilts to rest on an unsuspecting shoulder. I look peaceful.</p>
<p>I nearly don&#8217;t recognise myself.</p>

				<p>Trucker sat next to Victoria once. None of us believed it, but he&#8217;s got a pic and all. Said David was away, she was feeling lonely, riding the train, to find someone to talk to, like.</p>
<p>So Trucker says. The pic looks real, anyways.</p>
<p>But me, I never gets to sit to no-one famous. You&#8217;d think all of them TV stars is too important for the miracle of public transport, or something. Probably have their own train, like. Or, you know, a limo.</p>
<p>So anyways, this bloke next to me. Man, I swear that&#8217;s Neville Noon. That&#8217;s what I call a dilemma, now. I have all his books. I&#8217;m nearly pissing in my pants. But can I ask for a picture? What am I gonna tell my mates: &#8220;That&#8217;s Neville Noon that is, he&#8217;s like brilliant, he&#8217;s the next Stephen King?&#8221; Man, those guys like struggle to make out the punchline on Andy Capp. Crap.</p>
<p>Oh, what the fuck: &#8220;Look, mate, sorry to bother, but are you like maybe &#8211; &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s me, love&#8221;, interrupts this sunburnt geezer, jumping up, doing like air guitar or something. Fucking up my whole approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the fuck are you, Grandad?&#8221; Geez.</p>

				<p>Martin lives in a different world. His world is vivid and thrumming; overflowing with a rich complexity that his fellow passengers barely notice.</p>
<p>He sits, rocking slightly with the movement of the train, in the corner seat. An echoing thrup-thrup means they’re switched from the main track and he feels the driver ease up on the power: approaching a station. He wonders which window that kid bashing around on the roof is going choose for his grand entrance.</p>
<p>Despite the drunkard’s reek he smells an Italian countess: the perfect floral notes speak of perfume over priced and over applied. It intrigues him. Just as he is intrigued by the woman who smells of fear and goat’s blood and whose clothes rustled so strangely.</p>
<p>Martin loves train travel: it’s intriguing for a blind man.</p>

				<p>You can never be too careful. Not if you don&#8217;t want to be seen. It&#8217;s rush hour, right? Lots of people. Lots of eyes.<br />
So I went a bit more full-on than usual.<br />
Moustache, yes, of course.<br />
Sunglasses. Classic Ray-Bans.<br />
Hat. Fedora. I prefer a Trilby, looks nicer, but the forehead coverage isn&#8217;t so good. You can&#8217;t beat a Fez for comedy value, but it&#8217;s hardly low key, is it?<br />
Trench coat, black. Discreet. Sharp.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. I think I&#8217;ve been made. I guess with the reunion tour on, it&#8217;s to be expected.<br />

So I stand up, fling the disguise off, do the sign of the horns. Fans love that.<br />

				<p>“Hello, my name is Winnifred.”<br />
The train rocks forward, backward. Soothing.<br />
“Winnifred Jenkins.“<br />
There’s a bit of a commotion, now.<br />
“People call me Winnie.”<br />
Why is everyone shouting?<br />
“I’ve always wanted to work for Arcadia Inc.”<br />
There is definitely some sort of situation now. With Kung Fu. Or something.<br />
“I’m sorry I’m late. Some trouble on the train.”<br />
Is that a dagger? Why are those symbols glowing?<br />
“No, nothing serious, not really&#8230;”<br />
Blood. Blood everywhere.<br />
“Excuse the stains. Like I said, a little trouble&#8230;”<br />
Does no one hear her speak the killing words?<br />
“No, of course I don’t need to see a doctor.”<br />
Does no one see the man in grey, the man with the dead eyes?<br />
“Most of the blood isn’t even mine&#8230;”<br />
He reaches into the black torrent of her curse, he reaches into her black heart.<br />
“I would have rather died than missed this opportunity&#8230;”<br />
He turns her inside out, he folds her up. She’s gone.<br />
“It was nothing, really.”<br />
His icy hand reaches inside me, inside everyone.<br />
“I guess I keep cool in a crisis.”<br />
I give him my memory. I give it willingly.<br />
“I&#8217;ve already forgotten all about it. Let&#8217;s talk about the job, shall we?&#8221;</p>
