				<p>A dried flower fell from the book as I opened it &#8211; I knew it must have been hers. In those far off days she often hid things in books hoping to be surprised later. Sometimes it was small handwritten notes, sometimes extra cash that she had no need of, and sometimes souvenirs: a theatre ticket, a love letter or a flower.</p>
<p>It was a carnation, the vivid yellows faded by the intervening decades to an elegant tan. I must have given it to her, the other men always gave her roses, I was the one who knew she hated that cloying sweet smell.</p>
<p>I carefully fold the faded blossom back into the book and replace it on the bookshelf: I feel I have intruded.</p>

After nothing but airline food and snacks for two days the sizzling white meat on Daniel&#8217;s kebabs looked delicious. It was my first day in central Africa and I had been warned against eating meat from roadside stalls but Daniel’s bulking figure looked friendly enough so I had a closer look at his wares while we fuelled the vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&#8220;So it&#8217;s chicken huh, smells good!&#8221;</span><br />

I stopped at Daniel’s stall every week for the three months I worked there and his ready smile and juicy jungle kebabs never failed to please me. It was only on the day I was leaving for good, after I’d finished my last kebab, that I discovered the truth. </span></p>

				<p>Well, no sense in pussy-footing around: I might as well dive right in.<br />
Any second now.<br />
And.. now.<br />
Now.<br />
Ok, go.<br />
Now.<br />
Another hotel guest bustles out past me, clipping my shoulder as they do so, forcing me out into the street.<br />
Well, that did it I guess. I&#8217;m outside.</p>
<p>I breath deep to pull in the smells of the market. Some strong smell makes me cough and splutter, despite the filters on my nasal unit. Phew. Sort of spicy and cold and salty all at the same time. I tweak the settings, hoping not to embarrass myself.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see if this language module works as advertised.<br />
Feeling a bit more brave, I stride up to the very first street food stall I see.<br />
&#8220;Good morning!&#8221; I proclaim.<br />
&#8220;Morning,&#8221; the vendor (he, she, ve? I can never remember what Graxians prefer.) replies, raising a spiky eyebrow. &#8220;What can I do for you, human?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Two of… those, please&#8221; I say, pointing at a puddle of something vaguely tasty-looking off to one side in a strangely decorated container.<br />
&#8220;That,&#8221; the vendor says, picking up and sharpening his knife, &#8220;is my third-born brood. I&#8217;m going to have to take an arm from you for that insult.&#8221;<br />
The colour drains from my face and my life flashes before my eyes. So young. I&#8217;m so young. I had so much to see.<br />
&#8220;Oh, your face,&#8221; the vendor chuckles. &#8220;You lot are such easy targets.&#8221; He puts down the knife and picks up a plate. &#8220;What do they teach in your xenobiology classes these days?&#8221; He shakes his head, spoons a few tendrils on to the plate, and passes it to me. &#8220;That&#8217;s 35, please, buddy.&#8221;<br />
I snap back from my frozen state and scan the credits over to him.<br />
&#8220;Um,&#8221; gulp, &#8220;thanks.&#8221;<br />
I pick up a piece and turn it around, inspecting it.<br />
The Graxian makes an eating motion, suggesting I do it down-in-one. What is it they say: travel broadens the mind and loosens the bowels?<br />
Well.<br />
Any second now.<br />
And.. now.<br />
Now.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Not in here, cupcake,&#8221; Jake chirped as he crushed the zombie&#8217;s head with the baseball bat. The corpse crumpled to the floor and he took another swift swing, knocking the head clean off its slimy shoulders. He turned and smiled at Jane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice work, pardner,&#8221; she nodded nonchalantly at him. &#8220;Uh oh.&#8221; She pointed at the undead interloper with her grimy golf club. &#8220;See the shakin&#8217;? We gots ourselves an asploder.&#8221; She rushed up and rolled the body over their flung-together fence and collapsed them both onto their cabooses just in time to hear it snack, crackle, and pop into a hundred pestilent pieces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shee-it! When did they start doing that?&#8221; he said, brushing bone and blood off his jeans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just afore you got arrived. You ain&#8217;t see &#8216;em blow up before? Are you new here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stereo speakers up in the corner of the room fizzled and futzed: &#8220;Level 3.&#8221;</p>

				<p><em>So what’s the problem Mr B-Man!</em></p>
<p>Please call me Butcher, Boss, as your father did. I got your email about the Irish situation, the kid downstairs printed it out for me. I just don’t think I can do this, you know the baked goods and all.</p>
<p><em>But B, it’s a brilliant idea &#8211; creepy like the Joker from Batman you know &#8211; craaazy and scary. Send your nemesis something you knows he likes, cupcakes, iced with a threatening note &#8211; it’s fucking brilliant.</em></p>
<p>I don’t think the Irishman’s gonna get it Sir. You know his niece is living down on the south coast &#8211; we know some boys down there &#8211; we could leave a bloody-clear message like your dad did in ‘86.</p>
<p><em>We’re not gang-bangers Mr B; show some class. My dad said when it comes to intimidation you were the man. “The only guy who can get a severed horse’s head on short notice in New York city” &#8211; he often said that. Now are you still that man or not?</em></p>
<p>Yes Boss; for the family; if it is the new way; I’ll find us a friendly baker.</p>

				<p>I come thundering around the corner, dripping sweat. My car wouldn’t start: I ran all the way here. I pluck off my fedora and fan my face. It’s too damn hot today. I pray I’m not too late, that I haven’t missed my chance. I tune to the right frequency and hear spotty banter, chit chat. Everyone’s in a holding pattern. No-one’s spotted her yet: I still have my chance.</p>
<p>I put my hat back on and try to act casual as I make my way across the bus station tarmac to the ticket office. To my spot. Where I would be best positioned to keep watch.</p>
<p>My heart is finally slowing down as I scope out my surroundings in more detail. The ad screen behind me is too loud, so I pay the few bucks to mute it. I can claim back on expenses later, anyway. Probably. Maybe.</p>
<p>A quick visual and I spot two, three, maybe four familiar faces. The guy outside the diner. Newspaper, briefcase. So obvious. The ticket inspector waiting at lane 5. He’s good, real subtle. Something about the way his eyes are moving, though. Enhancements, maybe? Looks a little more sophisticated than anyone in his job should be. And the cleaner, far end. Uniform’s all wrong. Looks like he should be bell-hopping at the hotel down the road, not sweeping the floors here.</p>
<p>Intel says she’ll be coming here tonight. I check my scanner: due now. Due right now. Due in thirty seconds, according to predictions by our best analysts. I ping my recorder to make sure it’s on and rolling and initiate a scan. I start filtering out unwanted targets. Not her. Not her. Not her. Not even close.</p>
<p>I get that feeling that I sometimes do. Call it a hunch. Call it instinct. I leave my post and walk around behind the diner. And there she is. Beautiful. Incredible. Intel warned us that she would be pretty. They didn’t say she’d take my breath away.</p>
<p>10 wheeler. Diesel and electric hybrid. Two decks, bar on both.  Solar panels on every surface that isn’t a window. My god. She’s a monster. A beautiful, amazing, monster.</p>
<p>I send out the call over the network: I’ve spotted her. She’s mine. The responses come in. Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Acknowledge. Curse, spit, curse. Acknowledge. Acknowledge. I pull out my pad and key in the sequence that Intel gave me. The pad connects, checks, changes, and I now have a ticket for her. The Luxuron Plus. “The most advanced, sophisticated, luxury road travel vehicle in the world.”</p>
<p>Now it’s down to me. Get aboard, take notes. See what else she has that we don’t. Find ways of taking her ideas, making them better. There’s no way that we’re settling for second place this year. We will be best in class.</p>
<p>She pulls to a stop and I board, settle into my seat. I’m welcomed to her inaugural journey with a glass of champagne. It is delicious. Industrial espionage can be hard work. Today? Not so much.</p>

				<div class="entry-summary">
				<p>Mr Noble was sleeping with his feet on the tiny desk, in his cramped booth, in the small town of lesser Ripot. Although against regulations, none suffered for his lack of diligence for the terminus was devoid of all but a few shivering rats. It was rarely used by the town folk and never before six am; and as such Mr Noble thought it was impossible that his slumber would be disturbed. In this, he was wrong.</p>
<p>The disturbance; when it came;  took the form of Adam Kessler&#8217;s military surplus boots stomping up the path.  Both boots and man would be handsome if they were better kept and occasionally polished. He walked through the small building and stood before the posted timetable. With increasing anxiety he entirely failed to understand those cryptic state tabulations, he shook his head as if trying to wake, and then cautiously approached the booth.</p>
<p>“erm&#8230; when&#8217;s the next bus then?”</p>
<p>“Good morning young Adam, what brings you here at this ungodly hour?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve, umm, got to leave. Today.”</p>
<p>“Well I hope you haven&#8217;t had news then, often folk travel due to tragic news.”</p>
<p>“Well no; no; it&#8217;s nothing like that. Just time to move on, you know.”</p>
<p>“Well that seems rather a shame, from all accounts you&#8217;ve been doing rather well here. Your work on the estate house gardens has been much admired and the other staff like you well enough. “</p>
<p>“Seems everybody knows my business”</p>
<p>“Well my missus; she serves the tea at our betters bridge circle you see. And she heard your lady Thornton say that in all the years she&#8217;s lived here she never had no one better to clip her hedges than you were. And apparently you have a magic touch in the vegetable garden.”</p>
<p>“I do?”</p>
<p>“Well my missus said that the ladies talked something awful about the extraordinary size of your marrows.”</p>
<p>“So when does the bus come?”</p>
<p>“Well that would really depend on where your going, you heading back to the city son?:</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t care, the next bus!”</p>
<p>“Well, I don&#8217;t know about that, the next one is the 5.20am on the east country route, not much out that way for a young man, and surely no better employment.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll take it, right to the end, just a one way ticket.”</p>
<p>“Righto Sir, I&#8217;m sure you know your own mind.”</p>
<p>So both men waited: the one in his booth, the other on the hard cold bench against the opposite wall; one gradually returning to sleep, the other obviously agitated. Neither expected a third personage to appear but never the less one did in the form of the perfectly attired Mr Decker carrying a narrow wooden case made in fine chestnut. With the unquestioning confidence of one accustomed to command he approached the ticket booth.</p>
<p>“Is the five-thirty on time today, my good man?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, Mr Decker, what an uncommon surprise  - what bring you to my little terminus, surely your responsibilities at the house forbid much travel?”</p>
<p>“It is those very responsibilities that require I be here: Lord Thornton is arriving on the five -thirty and thus my enquiry as to its timeliness.”</p>
<p>“It left the city on time last night. A surprising time to travel for so distinguished a gentleman, his need must be pressing indeed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, rather a surprise for the staff I’m afraid, we were not expecting his return for some weeks but a telegram came late last night. And still that was not the strangest aspect of his missive, he required that I clean and polish his father’s shotgun and bring it to him here.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Most odd, but the rich must have their peccadillo&#8217;s, mustn’t they?”</p>
<p>Having carefully placed the gun case between them Mr Decker sat his stiff frame alongside Adam Kessler and slowly cracked the joints on his neck.</p>
<p>“You’ll be leaving us then Adam?”</p>
<p>“Yes Sir, I think it’s the best thing, on the 5.20am.”</p>
<p>“Let us hope that your bus is not late”</p>
<p>“Indeed Sir”</p>

				<p>The roads are wet and you’re tired; very tired. The kind of tired where your vision is bleary, your peripherals jump and the whole world starts looking strange and new. You promised to stop by 4am but you&#8217;re still driving, still looking for fares.</p>
<p>You discover him by an old church: a large man in a black trench coat, flagging you down in the rain. He runs up to the cab waving a fistful of cash; always a good sign.</p>
<p><em>Catie Park cemetery, please, it&#8217;s urgent.</em></p>
<p>You start figuring out the fare; it&#8217;s a long way, forty minutes; good fare.</p>
<p><em>here, take it. just go!</em></p>
<p>You look at the dripping bundle of currency thrust before you, thousands of dollars.  Brushing the hidden .38  for assurance you twist to look him in the face &#8211; he&#8217;s bald and overweight, with small ears.  The huge silver crucifix on his chest seems out of place but he&#8217;s normal enough so you swing out north onto Chester.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s on the highway that you first catch a glimpse of the knife, a wicked curved dagger glinting in the rear view mirror. You spin around in your seat yelling at him, you&#8217;re too tired for this shit tonight.</p>
<p><em>You are in no danger son, tonight we do the Lord&#8217;s work. This blade was not forged to spill mortal blood. Please watch the road. And do hurry, if the sun rises this will go badly for me.</em></p>
<p>Religious crazy is okay. You get used to it in this city.  But it’s best not to encourage crazy, so you stay silent and concentrate on the road.</p>
<p>You drop him outside the east gate of the cemetery. You hope he&#8217;s crazy; or he wins.</p>

				<p>You shout abuse at the man in the sharp suit as he practically spins you around, bouncing off you as your paths collide. He waves an apology, continuing on his way. </p>
<p>You step to the curb and hail a cab. One pulls up immediately. You are surprised at your luck (a cab, at this time of day, downtown?), but choose not to look the gift horse in the mouth, and dive into the back seat. You cough at the musty air. The driver asks you &#8220;where to?&#8221; in a heavy Eastern European accent, and you give him the head office address.</p>
<p>You shuffle through your meeting notes. The stakeholders will not be pleased. The letters seem to swim around on the page. You rub your eyes to try and focus. It doesn&#8217;t help. You sigh deeply and sit back.</p>
<p>You glance through the glass partition at the driver&#8217;s identity card. The picture shows red eyes and short, stubby, horns on her head. How absurd, you think. You catch the driver&#8217;s eye in the mirror. You jump up, startled, hitting the roof. Her eyes: red. She turns her head around, grins menacingly at you, and you notice the horns. How did you not see them before? She growls something at you, but you are too paralysed with fear to understand. </p>
<p>You notice that the cab has stopped moving, so you throw yourself out the door and onto the street. You breath deep the fresh air. The cab pulls aways at speed. You notice a small pin on your lapel. You didn&#8217;t put that on yourself. That man, before you got into the cab: he put it on you. But why? As you reach gingerly for it, it puffs to ash.</p>
<p>You think you&#8217;re in shock. You reach for your hipflask.</p>

				<p>&#8220;And… Action!&#8221;</p>
<p>This will be the one. The one that gets me the nomination. The ones that gets me the award.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fed up being mocked by… by everyone. Producers. Execs. Other directors. Even the goddam actors. I am a good director. I am *excellent* director. Remember the tapes: &#8220;You are empowered to be the center of your own excellence.&#8221; I am empowered to be the center of my own excellence. I am… shit, I am *something*, and it is great.</p>
<p>This will be the one. The perfect episode. Comedy. Tradegy. I&#8217;ll have the audience in tears of laughter one minute and tears of sorrow the next. The ratings will shoot through the roof.</p>
<p>And… glass smash! Fantastic. Great wrist work. The right amount of stiff, the right amount of limp. And… cue tear. Damn, he&#8217;s good. Look at that redness around the eye. Fantastic.</p>
<p>“And… Cut! This is gonna be the best damn episode of The Young and The Beautiful ever made. Great work boys!”</p>

				<p>The kids down at the bus stop told me you were asking about me so I figured I&#8217;d come and talk to you. I don&#8217;t really know that guy Harry, we did a few classes together last year at the tech, but I wouldn&#8217;t call him a friend. He&#8217;s just an acquantance who happens to live opposite my bus stop, I don&#8217;t really know much about him, and last Tuesday he was acting crazy.</p>
<p>He had this chick he&#8217;d been spading for weeks, ummm, sorry ma&#8217;am, this woman that he had been keen on had finally come up to his room but he didn&#8217;t have a condom. It was embarrassing! There was this mean looking old man watching from across the street and all these teenagers and this Harry guy keeps going on about this girl. I tried to quiet him down but he was frantic &#8211; I gave him a condom from my wallet eventually just to shut him up.</p>
<p>That Romeo was too cheap to buy his own box and he wasn&#8217;t subtle about taking it either &#8211; I had to tell the kids it was an imported sweetie; I couldn&#8217;t tell them the truth, they&#8217;re pretty naive about sex; especially that little Warren kid.</p>

				<p>Jesus, I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m still doing this after five years. I should have stayed on the stage. Or gone into porn like my agent was suggesting.<br />
“Oh, hi, Honey.”<br />
Eat olive, Smile.<br />
I wonder if my smile still looks good.<br />
“Just out. Relax, sweetie. I was thinking of you the whole time.”<br />
Drink.<br />
Oh, this day would have gone so much better if this was actually a martini and not just water. Evian, yes, but still. A shaken not stirred would be better.<br />
“I’m fixing myself another. Want one?”<br />
Jeffrey&#8217;s character hits glass, shatters, cries.<br />
This is the *third* take for this ridiculous scene. It takes them ten minutes just to hoover up all the sugar glass. Christ, Peter, just move on. It&#8217;s not Shakespeare.<br />
Turn around. Hunch. Tense.<br />
“What if I was? At least he’s there for me when I need him.”<br />
And… Scene. At last. Now for that drink. And wardrobe. And makeup.</p>

				<p>I suppose officer, there was a guy with faded jeans here Tuesday, we often see him, he takes the number 62, same as Johnny and Ted and Mike and me and that other kid Warren on Tuesdays and Fridays &#8211; we  see him most days after school. And there was another guy here Tuesday, came down from those flats across the way  &#8211; he was a weird guy; never seen a dude so desperate for chewing gum &#8211; it was real pathetic.</p>
<p>This other guy, he was like excited, but he wouldn&#8217;t just come out and say that he needed chewing gum, instead he says all this stuff about this girl who at his apartment and he really needed it right now &#8211; I dunno, you know all that crap that the varsity guys talk. Anyway the jeans guy starts on about how much it costs and eventually agrees to sell for like R10 &#8211; ja I know man, a lot for a single stick of gum but this guy doesn&#8217;t care he just passes the cash over and runs off back to his girl.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t normal gum, that&#8217;s what the jeans guy told me when I asked him after that other guy left &#8211; he wouldn&#8217;t let me see the pack either &#8211; like he was ashamed of it &#8211; but he told us it was special imported gum.</p>
