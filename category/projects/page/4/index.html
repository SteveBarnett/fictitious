				<p>“Mrs Peirson? Hello, I’m Mrs White. Please come in it’s nice to meet you in person. “</p>
<p>“Why yes, it is a lovely old place. Come through to the kitchen. Let me apologise for the smell – the housekeeper has been cooking tripe for the dogs” – boiled down chicken blood doesn’t smell like tripe but Mrs Peirson wouldn’t know that.</p>
<p>“You say cloves? And cinnamon? Well it is a kitchen&#8230;” – scorched bat fur smells nothing like cloves! Mother Nastri would have cackled wildly at that:  She was quietly proud of the strange reeks that issued from her quarters behind the main house. In those long forgotten years in Haiti such stenches advertised her power and artifice.</p>
<p>“Now please sit down. As I understand it from your letter your problem is, umm, well, not in the bedroom; but rather in that you don’t conceive?” – it had  better be: I spend the whole morning tying and retying the six pointed knot in the blood slick rope – ‘eighteen  repetitions to be sure’, I was taught , ’each one as flawless as the child to be born.’</p>
<p>“Now sit down and have some tea – Earl Grey for you dear and Slimmer’s herbal infusion for me: it tastes terrible” – that at least is true, the rum is rough island gut – raw and burning the way Mother Nastri liked it.</p>
<p>“My mind-technique is simple &#8211; have a look at this rope, run it though your hands, concentrate on it” – a real hangman’s noose, used a decade ago to execute a certain John Muller, not easy to acquire in civilised England.</p>
<p>“Keep concentrating; close your eyes and visualise the soft maroon rope in your mi&#8230;” – this bit is always difficult, there is just no polite way to spit on someone in England.</p>
<p>“Oh! I am so sorry Mrs Peirson; that tea must have gone down the wrong way. Here, let me dry you with this towel. I feel terrible, I can’t apologise enough&#8230;” – well that’s that then, a job well done, another patient sent forth to motherhood.</p>
<p>“But you have the hang of it Mrs Peirson – just remember the mind-technique every night and your pregnancy is assured”</p>

				<p>&#8220;Then the actress said: &#8216;And that&#8217;s as big as it&#8217;s going to get!&#8217; Honestly, I nearly wet myself laughing,&#8221; Reverend Green said, putting down his cup of tea and passing his handkerchief to Mrs Winsham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, Reverend,&#8221; she said, dabbing away the tears of laughter at her crow&#8217;s feet. &#8220;Oh, goodness me. I feel so much better. Thank you so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A pleasure, Mrs Winsham. I&#8217;ll be here whenever you need a chat.&#8221; He smiled softly at her as he plucked another Hob Nob from the plate.</p>
<p>Mrs Winsham took a final sip of tea and gathered her things. She nodded at him and waddled down the church aisle and out into the soft evening sun.</p>
<p>His hands twitched. A little rain of crumbs fell on his lap. I just need to pop down to the cellar. Just to make sure it&#8217;s still there; still safe. He caught sight of himself in the mirror: nibbling away like a squirrel at a nut. Just need to hold it again. He set off toward the cellar.</p>
<p>He pressed his hand against his chest. The key was still there. He pulled off his dog collar and rolled up his sleeves as he pushed open the heavy oak door leading down to the cellar.</p>
<p>He let his eyes adjust to the dark for a moment, then strode purposefully across the hard stone floor to the small lockbox in the farthest, darkest, corner. He opened it and picked up his old service pistol and breathed in the oily, metallic, smell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed you, old friend,&#8221; he whispered, as Mrs Winsham flicked on the lights and her eyes opened so wide he thought they might pop out of her head.</p>

				<div class="entry-summary">
				<p>The candlestick felt right: heavy, finely carved, balanced. Professor Plum lifted it experimentally, swung it gently from side to side, turned it over in her hands. The mechanism was superbly integrated, the surface smooth. No sign of tampering. Satisfied, she placed it in the centre of the round table, between the crystal ball and the skull.</p>
<p>The skull &#8211; on second thoughts, she removed the skull. It was simply too much, an extravagance too many. Hard to resist, of course, when ordering online, but nonetheless a mistake. She placed the grinning head back in the trunk &#8211; a genuine Moroccan camphor chest, very atmospheric and altogether a worthwhile expense. Very occult, very spiritual. Yes.</p>
<p>She checked the curtains she had draped over the library shelves one more time &#8211; heavy velvet things, subtly altered to swing and bulge mysteriously at the press of a button. Very eerie. Very authentic.</p>
<p>She felt ready; the subjects &#8211; guests, she needed to think of them as guests &#8211; would arrive shortly to take their seats around the table. They were drawn from all avenues of society &#8211; a reverend, a retired colonel, all sorts of different characters. The experiment depended on achieving a varied mix of believers and sceptics, young and old, religious and secular.</p>
<p>The Professor smiled as she allowed herself to imagine the findings: &#8220;The Effects of Supernatural Terror on the Human Psyche&#8221;. Of course, she was aware that true terror did not come from self-lighting candles, levitating tables and rustling curtains. These would merely create the atmosphere: her experiment truly centred around Dr Black and the role he had agreed to play.</p>
<p>It would be absolutely perfect.</p>

				<div class="entry-summary">
				<p>The colonel walked across the crumbling mansion, each pace carefully measured. His polished leather shoes made a crisp click with each stride. Despite his decade long retirement he still carried himself like an officer of the queen&#8217;s army &#8211; at least in public.</p>
<p>He entered the lush, humid confines of the conservatory; it was his custom to spend his evenings here nurturing his orchids. A package had been left inside the door &#8211; the pump outlet pipe that had been on order for weeks.  Although none would disturb him here, he quietly turned the key in the lock before taking the heavy pipe to the back courtyard.</p>
<p>He topped up the nutrient mixes in a few containers as he passed through the rows of orchids. He didn&#8217;t actually like orchids, they were too temperamental, but they were an appropriate hobby for an ageing gentleman. This hobby allowed him to obtain a variety of piping, pumps, sprayers and agricultural chemicals without fuss and without arousing the suspicions of servants or family.</p>
<p>After unlocking the low doorway, the colonel entered the glassed-over courtyard and set to work dismantling the main nutrient pump. He worked with clean, efficient precision: removed his jerry-rigged connector, fitted the new lead pipe and got the system flowing again. The colonel sighed, sat down in his camp chair and stretched out his legs. He was proud of the system; not many could design such a complicated set-up; six years as an army mechanic in North Africa teaches one about pumping water.</p>
<p>He pulled a small wooden pipe from his pocket and casually stuffed it from the drying table behind him. After lighting the pipe carefully, and taking a few slow drags, he held the pipe out before him and considered it deliberately.</p>
<p>The pipe was from his favourite grandson &#8211; &#8216;a souvenir from Africa&#8217;, the boy had said, &#8216;I know you&#8217;ll like it&#8217;. It was a rather communicative gift to a grandfather who doesn&#8217;t smoke. He thought how he had always liked the boy – perhaps he should invite him to the conservatory one evening soon.</p>

It’s probably more than I could afford anyway. Me? Postman. Delivering the mail. See: I’ve the bag and everything.

<p>“That’s very kind, but perhaps a little bit of an exaggeration. I wasn’t using my soul; you needed one. I saw it as more of a business transaction.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but now you’ll go to Hell. And I’ll go to Heaven. For ever.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that will be a problem. Let’s just say I have friends in… low places.”</p>

<p>“Y – yes, Rick, Rick is fine.”</p>
<p>“Rick sounds great. I’m actually nearly done here, and I think you and I might hit it off, actually. Wanna dump this idiot and blow this joint?”</p>

<p>“This negotiation concerns them; it’s outcome will determine the continued existence of everything they have ever known. They have, I believe Mr Johnson, a right to listen.”</p>

<p>“For which I will pay you four hundred Cesari pure by anonymous transfer.”</p>
<p>“I have further requirements, these long survey trips create domestic difficulties. I require a paid vacation to Belruga Playspace for my mates and I.”</p>
<p>“What, all of them?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately tradition dictates only the primary seventy-seven should be taken on a trip of this nature.”</p>

				<p>Developed in Japan in the early 22nd century, tokonomas were first intended as a bridging device to help students adjust to an independent life. They were programmed to follow their owner around, picking up untidy elements, demanding the owner put on a jumper, lecturing their masters on topics such as safe sex and wholesome nutrition.</p>
<p>Rather than wean themselves off their tokonoma, many students took comfort in the ongoing, harmless presence of a responsible entity, giving rise to the Tokoma Generation &#8211;   child-like grown-ups still accompanied by their now worn-out robotic minders.</p>

<p>Some researchers argue that Fortochka is more likely to make an appearance late at night, when babushkas get sleepy and the story needs a quick ending. Others, however, claim that Fortochka is the foremost, unsung, villain of Russian fairy tale.</p>

				<p>A rare state reached only in certain tiny Welsh pubs of a particular level of quaintness. The prerequisite is a happy event, such as an encounter with a winsome wench or possibly the imminent arrival of a bonny babe. The patron in question can be said to be &#8220;gadrooning&#8221; once he has reached a perfect balance between wanting to buy another round for all and sundry, and going back to participate in the happy event.</p>
<p>Gadrooning, when done correctly, can take hours. A well timed squinch may help things progress &#8211; if the barman can be made to play along.</p>

				<p>Technical word referring the the largest pipe of a pipe organ. The Brahmasthan has the greatest air volume and thus sustained notes require the greatest effort of the part of the bellows operators. It is also the lowest pitched pipe and often associated with incontinence among the elder parish members.</p>
