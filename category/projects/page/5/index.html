				<p>That was the day it happened.</p>
<p>“Superpowers” they called it. Like everyone was suddenly flying or had x-ray vision. But it wasn’t like that: it was mostly small, strange things.</p>
<p>My buddy Mike gained an incredible sense of smell. Could tell you where you’d been days ago. But the power only worked one day a week. My old lady’s left arm became fireproof. Just the arm, just the left.<br />
I was sitting waiting in Grand Central one day. She was late, as usual. I looked down at my watch, then up at the station clock: 11.24. I’d been there almost an hour. I stared down at my watch again, sighed. My eyes widened as I followed the hands of my watch slow down, then wind backwards, then stop at 11.05. I looked back up at the station clock: 11.24.</p>
<p>&sect;</p>
<p>In the morning I tried again. My watch was on the breakfast counter. I concentrated on it, hard, and saw it slow. A fly took off from a dirty plate in the sink and flew across my face. As it crossed over my watch it slowed down, then stopped: it suspended in the air. I concentrated harder, and the hands started turning back. The fly moved backwards along its flight path. About ten centimetres out it suddenly burst from the bubble, sped up, shot away on another trajectory.</p>
<p>&sect;</p>
<p>Before I knew it I’d jumped back to the day we all got our powers. Then three days before. Then a fortnight. Then a year. Then more. Then I knew I’d lost control of it.<br />
And now I’m scratching this into a cave wall with an arrow head. And then I feel the familiar tingle, and I know I’m about to go again.</p>

				<p>In the Thi’si retreat high in the mountains of Nepal the warrior monks began the final cycle of the chant they had begun 200 years before.  This prayer was given to call the spirit of the great warrior Seiyan, an arhat whose enlightenment had led him beyond the strictures of space and time. On the altar kneels the Assiri: a beautiful, golden youth with dark hair and fierce eyes. Since his careful selection in childhood the best teachers have dedicated their lives to moulding him into the perfect vessel. When the cycle completes a perfect silence falls over the monastery. They gaze expectantly at the Assiri.</p>
<p>Liefe Wessels is sitting on her uncomfortable couch in Kuilsriver. She has never been wealthy and long years of hardship show in her lined face. This year her third child will leave home and for a moment she cheerfully contemplates her autumn years of soap operas and church fetes.</p>
<p>As the enlightenment of Seiyan descends upon her she sighs deeply – time to have a little talk with that violent drunk, Mr Johnson, at number 22 and then on to the central African problem. But before all the work begins she thinks to indulge a childhood fantasy. As she looks about at ancient Gaza, 2500BCE, she smiles: she had always dreamed of seeing the pyramids.</p>

				<p>I was in a bad mood that day. Worse than usual, I mean. I had been there on my own for what felt like decades. It&#8217;s always hard to tell the exact passing of time when you&#8217;re inside, isn&#8217;t it? It feels like that edge between being asleep and awake: not quite on either side.<br />
I understanded that I needed to be punished. I deserved a less spacious cage. But at least when I was in a lamp I was moving around in the world quite a lot. And sometimes you can sense other Djinn nearby. You ever get that? Like a tingling in your fingertips. If you were corporeal, I mean.</p>
<p>Where was  I? Ah, yes: bad mood. I needed to grant some wishes. I was feeling rough around the edges. Bad comedown. Then I sensed him. A bit flat and flavourless maybe, but better than nothing. He must have been quite determind: once I was out, I could see that the weather was rough. Gale force winds, rain hammering down. But, he made it to the door of my lighthouse. He didn&#8217;t even try to peer through the porthole, just peeled off a glove and rubbed at it.</p>
<p>I welcomed the familiar sting of it as I twisted and turned my way into the flesh that had formed itself up from the stone and moss. I have a theory about the bodies we use, by the way. Something to do with spare wishes, balancing of energies from retractions, things like that. Later, though. More details later. I opened the door to my bland friend.</p>
<p>He stared at me. Looked me up and down.<br />
&#8220;Three, correct? Anything I want?&#8221;<br />
It had been a long time since I&#8217;d had one of those. Usually I needed to do some parlour tricks as a convincer.<br />
&#8220;Aye.&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Three.&#8221; I lit my pipe.</p>
<p>I played the old one, two, switch on him. No surprises for the first two. He got what he asked for. Got him feeling comfortable for the last big wish. The finale. The blockbuster.<br />
&#8220;I want to be connected. I want to feel connected. To the world.&#8221;<br />
I nodded and told him to close his eyes. Completely unnecessary of course, but I like to keep the showmanship going. I licked my thumb and pushed it gently against his forehead. The air crackled with static as I broke his body down into bits and bytes. I pushed his conciousness into the Internet, into telephone networks.<br />
I left him feel every cut of data being chopped into packets. I let him feel the crunch of the data colliding at the end of each journey. I let him feel the stretch of being pulled half way around the world, then back again.</p>
<p>I just had time for a quick chuckle and a glance up at the Fresnel lens before I stung out of the flesh, back to the aether.</p>

				<p>The first card fluttered onto the table, feather-light. “A simple opening”, said Abdul Ibn Hassan, resplendent in red. On the face of the card, a lone bird floated in an endless sky. “I wish I could fly”, it whispered in a young woman’s voice. It looked at us bitterly. “She missed her next two wishes, too”, added Abdul. “Bird brains, you know.”</p>
<p>We nodded. A traditional start, but that is what I was expecting. Fakir Rabdan, floating on his cloud of golden dust, drew the next card from his curling beard. It clinked like falling coins. On it, a beautiful young man looked into a mirror, hands raised to his face. He shimmered, gleamed, shone, but did not move. “I wish to be beautiful, and rich!” cried a young voice. “Everything I touch should turn to gold”. Fakir smiled, teeth like diamonds. “You bait them with your frippery, Fakir!” protested Abdul, smiling. But that, we knew, was allowed.</p>
<p>“Your turn, Safik!”</p>
<p>I knew to start low. It would not do, to overplay my hand this early in the game. The stakes were too high.</p>
<p>A guitar riff, a drum beat. My card vibrated with unheard rhythms. Thousands of teenage girls raised up pictures of a man with straggly blond hair and smudged eyeliner. They  cried and screamed as a coffin was carried through crowded streets. “I want to be famous” sang a rough voice, wistfully.</p>
<p>The others looked at me quizzically. “The most famous ones are always dead”, I explained. The card shivered, but stayed.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>And so we played.</p>
<p>We brought dead loved ones back to life: Abdul made them soulless and ravenous, Fakir left them buried alive. I had them kidnapped by secret agents and experimented on.</p>
<p>We granted immortality: The cards showed wizened, shrunken ancients;  walking skeletons; soulless cyborgs.</p>
<p>We offered happiness: mindless idiocy, delusional schizophrenia. Grinning maniacs frozen in eternal ecstasy.</p>
<p>The points racked up, in their secret ways, in complicated combinations. We all felt the game’s tides change again and again as the super-strong crushed their lovers, men stepped on the moon and could not find breath to ask for air, women asked for beauty and were disowned by their families. Round and round we went, each hoping it would be our turn to win.</p>
<p>The game is played for the highest stakes.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>“The end game, my dear friends”, announced Fakir finally, stroking his silver beard. He was in the lead: his last card, a city trapped in a perfect day, doomed to relive it again and again, never changing, still glowed faintly atop the tall pile on the table.</p>
<p>Abdul carefully removed one last card from his crimson turban. He smiled his sly smile as he laid it down. “Peace on Earth” asked a sweet voice from within.  A soft glow touched every being in the world. For one small moment no creature harmed another. It was as if the world held its breath.</p>
<p>The moment passed, and violence resumed. “Peace on Earth” laughed Abdul. “How about that!” He was right to laugh. He was in the lead now.</p>
<p>Fakir, pale and drawn, reached into the recesses of his kaftan. He presented his last card. It hovered and twirled in the air over the table. “Total control over reality” said a confident voice. The air inside the card stood still. “He needs to move individual molecules to get anything to happen”, explained Fakir. A man was frozen, helpless, in the middle of his card. Fakir beamed; his lead was restored.</p>
<p>My opponents turned to me. “The last move is yours, Safik.” Fakir’s lead over me was vast. “Even if you cannot win, you must play”, Abdul reminded me. Those are the rules of this ancient game, a game played for the highest stake: one jinn’s freedom.</p>
<p>I drew my last card out from my heart, where I hid my greatest secrets. It showed a young man in torn jeans rubbing an ancient oil lamp. A jinn emerged, majestic and blue. The scene was silent, but jinn and man talked or a long while, with much scratching of heads and waving of hands. Finally, they shook hands.</p>
<p>“I wish to become the Jinn, Safik Al Shahad, and take his place in the lamp”, said a young voice, resounding clean and clear all around us. The card swelled, grew.</p>
<p>Turned itself inside out.</p>
<p>Comprehension dawned on the red face, then the golden one. The game was won. I felt myself lifting up from the table, away from my lamp, free at last. I looked down on myself and saw my old, torn jeans.</p>
<p>I was back.</p>

				<p>Is it difficult to trick a spoilt prince into self destruction? What art is needed to lead a wise man filled with curiosity to his doom? Does it take a great skill to destroy true love’s purity? These are easy entertainments: the seeds of destruction written clear for all to see.</p>
<p>In the year 1099AD I sought such morsels of amusement at the walls of Jerusalem. I gazed down upon the thronging crowds of desperate men, dying far from home and sick with bloodlust, and I smiled at the abundance. That is when I first saw Samuel Dimante moving among the Christian lines. To my unnatural sight he shone: a calm, compassionate, thinking man unaffected by the raging torrents of hatred and lust that mortals call war. I saw a man of grace and honour; a healer and a priest standing uncorrupted amongst the horrors of his kind. I saw a fine opportunity.</p>
<p>I stood by him as he prayed for victory on a quiet knoll in the evening. ‘Just ask and it will be so’, I say too close to his ear. With the usual injunctions he turned on me, swearing to pay no heed to my deceitful talk. I laughed quietly in the dark, why would I deceive when the truth would suffice?</p>
<p>‘Your prayers will be answered and not by my hand: the Saracen cannot hold another day. Jerusalem will fall on the morrow. In your heart you know this, your commanders know it and the soldiers feel it in their blood.  Tomorrow all that has been suffered will be avenged. Tomorrow Christian men will ravage victorious through the streets of Jerusalem bringing God’s fierce retribution to the starving infidels within. At last those who have stood against your church will be brought to swift and savage justice – blood will run on the steps of the Temple of Solomon.’</p>
<p>‘In the morning, Sir, I will return to hear your prayers’</p>
<p>I was loathe to leave him that night but thoughtful men need time to think. And there was play enough to distract me: a young knight willing to trade his companion’s lives so that he could return to his lover alive – he should have said ‘alive and whole’. But when the dawn began to lighten the sky I had not forgotten Samuel Dimante and I stood beside him at his morning prayers.</p>
<p>‘Lord, should the walls, by your grace, fall today, let each soldier as he touches Jerusalem’s holy ground feel your compassionate grace. Give them the knowledge that all mankind are brothers in your sight &#8211; let them see only the pure souls within as you do and not the outwards trappings of belief. Amen.’</p>
<p>As he finished he slowly opened his eyes and looked straight into mine. Quietly I echoed his Amen and, with a slight smile, disappeared.</p>
<p>After the east bastion fell Samuel was among the first to penetrate the narrow city streets. All was chaos then: no man could tell Saracen from Christian, none could tell friend from foe. There was no ally to defend your back and no enemy before you; there was nought but angry, violent men filled with fear and battle-lust.</p>
<p>Mortal histories say the street of Jerusalem flowed ankle deep in blood that day in an orgy of violence rarely matched. Samuel was among the few survivors that day – he lived till old age in dark regret. That was not my doing, perhaps his God chose to spare him?</p>

The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>when she was little, she came to the logical conclusion that this was the room for drawing in.  Two nights without supper for drawing monsters on the wall paper.  Now the monsters hid behind the stripes and supper was served without issue. </span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>She imagined herself in the dress of the Shepherdess on the right.  A pastoral naïve fancy.  Pink with white trim. A bonnet and a crook.  Nothing you could actually tend sheep in.  But she’d be out of this house and on the moors.  With a dark, dangerous shepherd boy helping her tend her flock. </span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>Uncle Alaister, leaning against it.  The dark wood a prop for his elbow as he told stories of India and the Maharaj.  His waxed mustache and carefully pressed suit.  One hand tucked into the pocket of his waistcoat.  Such a fucking liar.  He’d never even been as far as Southampton.   </span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>The efforts of her mother.  Simpering foolish scenes.  Washed out and faded.  She mulled the comparison between the art and the artist.  And felt a suffocating beat of panic at her own prospects. </span></a>, <a href="">two samplers and three needlework pictures<span>The showy pieces of her sister.  “Why can’t you be more like Maude?”   </span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>Jeremy, awkward in his Sunday suit.  He’d beat her at cards that day, and been allowed to run a hand along her calf to the top of her stockings. </span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span> A gift from father to mother, and disliked from the start.  Uncomfortable and brittle.  A fitting metaphor, perhaps, for a marriage of good arrangement.</span></a>, some little <a href="">satin-wood tables<span> She loved those little tables.  Perfect, smooth, beautifully crafted.  The elegant legs and carefully inlayed wood.  She longed to pick one up smash it against the wall.  </span></a> – and a hideous and rather uncomfortable <a href="">Victorian sofa<span>It might have been uncomfortable, but she smiled every time she saw it, remembering a rather refreshing afternoon with Jeremy as he bent her over its upholstered arm and very vigorously introduced her to her favourite new parlor game.</span></a>.

The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>Not so in the years that the family gatherings happened. For some reason this was always their haven from Uncle John&#8217;s military style discipline. It was their place to build tents, play with Oupa&#8217;s pipes and listen to scratchy LPs.</span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>Time and again they would hide like naughty school girls behind the ruins of local block houses and listen to the cavorting of the young shepherds and their companions in the night. They always guessed there was more to &#8220;Red at night&#8221;&#8230;</span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>Suzy and I used to run our marbles from side to side. Her on the one end and me on the other. It was a long shot, but the joy of success!</span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>The question was always about the garish frame. Why gold leaf and why the intricacy surrounding such a tranquil scene?</span></a>, <a href="">two samplers<span>The fear of these hung around for years after Aunt Nicea passed away. She used them as punishment for not producing decorations that were up to her standards. To her credit she was always pushing them to improve and it did show in there later schooling. Reflecting on it they couldn&#8217;t help but think that she was living vicariously through their achievements.</span></a>, and <a href="">three needlework pictures<span>His gran had tried her best to teach him the finer details; but somehow he had never mastered the accuracy required to turn needlework into an art form. These were his pride and joy, brimming with his love for the nostalgia of days gone by, though the eclectic colouring was a bit too modern for the themes of the triple ducks flying by. Nobody blamed him for this conceit, since there is always a danger of things going astray if you are colour blind.</span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>All artworks in the making. It was always a competition between the uncles who could produce the best compositions, but the talent was palpable.</span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span>Mahogany crica 1778 with gold leaf inlay in a non-typical asymmetric style with marching chair reupholstered to match the original. Unique and priceless.</span></a>, some little <a href="">satin-wood tables<span>Klondike, freecell, spider, castle, bisley, demon &#8211; to call him a connoisseur would be an understatement of epic proportions. These tables were dedicated to an art form practiced in very few places, an art form of such subtlety that to watch was to dream.</span></a> – and a hideous and rather uncomfortable <a href="">Victorian sofa<span>Now that Gran was no longer around and Miss Daisy was sleeping permanently under the trees there was very little reason to keep it, it is just that no-one had the heart to do anything about it. There was an unwritten agreement to let it just dissolve into nothingness, that was more conceit than wishful thinking.<br />

The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>It had not always been a drawing-room, though a new visitor would never notice this. Madame had ensured the transformation was complete: even the elaborate fireplace and bay window had been torn out and made unrecognisable through the skilful efforts of Mr French and his apprentices. Only the sofa, a Victorian monstrosity without charm or comfort, remained untouched, a jarring reminder of that fateful night.<br />
 </span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>So, one story could be that that little shepherdess, the one with the battered nose and faded skirts, is secretly a princess. The daughter of a powerful, handsome, and talented King, lost in a far away land. One day, he will ride onto the mantelpiece on his fine horse and pick up the little shepherdess with paint-stained hands (in Emily&#8217;s mind, the King is invariably a very fine painter), swing her onto the front of his saddle, and take her far, far away from this dreary drawing-room.<br />
That&#8217;s just one possible story, of course.</span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>Faux-greek columns soared arrogantly around the cavity of the fireplace, filled with meticulously arranged, skillfully dried, artfully lifeless roses. So flammable, Emily often thought. So very flammable.</span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>Dark, mysterious landscapes where twisted roads soar up endless cliffs, and ancient trees reach upwards as if to pierce the firmament. The signature is a twisted scrawl, starting with a &#8220;Z&#8221;. They are very valuable, Madame always says, but she does not sell them.<br />
</span></a>, <a href="">two samplers<span>Both the Gothic and the Cursive Alphabets lack the &#8220;E&#8221;.<br />
Emily has repeatedly apologised for this, but nonetheless she has been banned from any further embroidering by Madame.</span></a>, and <a href="">three needlework pictures<span>Fine works; Madame is acknowledged to have exceptional skill with the needle. They are for Emily&#8217;s dowry, Madame says: &#8220;The Sleepy Cat&#8221;; &#8220;Girls Playing&#8221;. &#8220;A Forest Encounter&#8221;.<br />
Emily tries to be grateful, truly, but she finds the pictures disturbing. In her eyes, they are subtly subversive: the Cat, seemingly dozing in the sun, appears dead to her. And what is that&#8230; thing&#8230; the Girls are so merrily throwing?<br />
The forest thing, hiding in the tree branches, comes to her in her dreams. It is not a pleasant Encounter.</span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>Conrad and Julia Cuttner &#8211; straight-laced and narrow-toothed, just like Auntie Anne.<br />
Richard and Robert Phillis-Smythe &#8211; specially scrubbed for this photo, no doubt, gleaming with gleeful guilt. In the background, Louis the Cat, petrified as per usual.<br />
Gwynneth Smythe &#8211; perfect, polished and marketable. Madame simply <em>adores </em>this photograph.<br />
There are no pictures of Emily, of course.</span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span>A grand old piece, taking more space than the drawing room affords it. It sits, fat, in it corner, glistening in stray sunlight, its surface clear except for that one, elegant volume. Madame&#8217;s diary.<br />
Emily has read it a million times in her imagination. Her mind supplies staggering secrets, weaves clandestine narratives, reveals the truth of the lumpy sofa, the mysterious painter, the unwanted child.<br />
She has never dared touch that desk.</span></a>, some little <a href="">satin-wood tables<span>Refined, sophisticated, delicate.<br />
Madame will probably leave them to Cousin Gwynneth one day.</span></a> – and a hideous and rather uncomfortable <a href="">Victorian sofa<span>It is a summer evening, sixteen years ago. Madame is a young girl, perching on the edge of the lumpy, large sofa. Her soft eyes are locked into the gaze of a young man, handsome, carefree and in love. The house is silent in the setting sun, all potential bastions of propriety and responsibility miraculously drawn away on serendipitous errands. Two hands, one marked with paint, touch: hesitantly, then urgently. Fate, merciless and swift, ties two lives together; and creates a third.<br />
</span></a>.

The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>The strongest memory I have of the drawing room is the smell.<br />
There was a salty sea-like smell, almost a taste. The nearest piece of coastline was more than 60 miles away. The smell began tickling your nostrils a few paces away from the door. Once you entered the room, it became almost sweet. Like the smell of meat just before it turns. The strangest thing was that the smell would stay with my shoes for days afterwards.</span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>They were somewhat cracked and crumbled, much like the host.The two figures shared three hands between them and the legs of the bases were broken: they listed towards each other like drunkards on a street corner on a Saturday night.</span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>If I hadn&#8217;t had to sit through hours of his blathering about it before he had it installed, I would have sworn that the mantelpiece was made of lino. Bargain bin cast offs at that. As it was, I knew that he&#8217;d paid through the nose to have it imported from Balochistan. The stone itself wasn&#8217;t cheap, but the bribes for the Customs officials to turn a blind eye to the boys he was smuggling in with the stone had nearly bankrupted him. &#8220;Worth every penny,&#8221; he had leered at me over a glass of port one night.</span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>The frames at least matched the elegance of the furniture: rich, smooth, wood; crisp lines. The paintings themselves were a different story. The scenes depicted were easily recognisable as various views from the gardens because the house itself was so striking. The technique left something to be desired, however. The flat washes were heavy-handed and the wet in wet looked more like accidents than artistic endeavour.</span></a>, <a href="">two samplers<span>&#8220;ABCDEFGHIJKL<br />

How&#8230; unimaginative.</span></a>, and <a href="">three needlework pictures<span>The most polite way to describe the content of the pictures would be &#8220;unconventional.&#8221; At first glance they seemed innocent enough, but perhaps haphazardly made. Closer inspection revealed something perhaps more sinister: occult symbols and iconography. I never dared to ask directly if the pictures were their equivalent of a crucifix, for fear of a direct answer.</span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>Seventeen. The number of photos he had of his niece and two nephews was now seventeen. The first few that went up felt like he was just the proud uncle. After the tenth one found its place on the the wall it started to become a little odd. Then he started making ever more elaborate frames for them: card; tissue paper; buttons; glitter.I suppose that&#8217;s why he was always hanging around Mrs Williams&#8217; haberdashery as a boy.</span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span>The desk was exquisite: a thing of beauty. It was one of the few things in the house that I coveted. While so many other things were in a state of disrepair (the curtains, the Afghans), he kept the desk in the most mint of conditions. I would have loved to have a rummage around in his drawers, but he never left it unattended. It was almost as if he was frightened it would run off if it looked around and realised where it was.</span></a>, some little <a href="">satin-wood tables<span>The tables were of such a high quality and craftsmanship that the knitted coasters splayed upon them jarred all the more. The surfaces were often slightly sticky to the touch, as though they&#8217;d been cleaned in a hurry upon hearing the door bell.</span></a> – and a hideous and rather uncomfortable <a href="">Victorian sofa<span>I chose to remain standing rather than sit on the sofa. It&#8217;s not so much the uncomfortableness of it, more that dark patch at one end. Who knows what it is, or how long it&#8217;s been there. Are those <em>claw </em>marks in the wood? My goodness.<br />

				<p>Now that Gran was no longer around and Miss Daisy was sleeping permanently under the trees there was very little reason to keep it, it is just that no-one had the heart to do anything about it. There was an unwritten agreement to let it just dissolve into nothingness, that was more conceit than wishful thinking.</p>

				<p>It is a summer evening, sixteen years ago. Madame is a young girl, perching on the edge of the lumpy, large sofa. Her soft eyes are locked into the gaze of a young man, handsome, carefree and in love. The house is silent in the setting sun, all potential bastions of propriety and responsibility miraculously drawn away on serendipitous errands. Two hands, one marked with paint, touch: hesitantly, then urgently. Fate, merciless and swift, ties two lives together; and creates a third.</p>

				<p>So, one story could be that that little shepherdess, the one with the battered nose and faded skirts, is secretly a princess. The daughter of a powerful, handsome, and talented King, lost in a far away land. One day, he will ride onto the mantelpiece on his fine horse and pick up the little shepherdess with paint-stained hands (in Emily&#8217;s mind, the King is invariably a very fine painter), swing her onto the front of his saddle, and take her far, far away from this dreary drawing-room.</p>
