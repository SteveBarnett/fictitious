The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>when she was little, she came to the logical conclusion that this was the room for drawing in.  Two nights without supper for drawing monsters on the wall paper.  Now the monsters hid behind the stripes and supper was served without issue. </span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>She imagined herself in the dress of the Shepherdess on the right.  A pastoral naïve fancy.  Pink with white trim. A bonnet and a crook.  Nothing you could actually tend sheep in.  But she’d be out of this house and on the moors.  With a dark, dangerous shepherd boy helping her tend her flock. </span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>Uncle Alaister, leaning against it.  The dark wood a prop for his elbow as he told stories of India and the Maharaj.  His waxed mustache and carefully pressed suit.  One hand tucked into the pocket of his waistcoat.  Such a fucking liar.  He’d never even been as far as Southampton.   </span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>The efforts of her mother.  Simpering foolish scenes.  Washed out and faded.  She mulled the comparison between the art and the artist.  And felt a suffocating beat of panic at her own prospects. </span></a>, <a href="">two samplers and three needlework pictures<span>The showy pieces of her sister.  “Why can’t you be more like Maude?”   </span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>Jeremy, awkward in his Sunday suit.  He’d beat her at cards that day, and been allowed to run a hand along her calf to the top of her stockings. </span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span> A gift from father to mother, and disliked from the start.  Uncomfortable and brittle.  A fitting metaphor, perhaps, for a marriage of good arrangement.</span></a>, some little <a href="">satin-wood tables<span> She loved those little tables.  Perfect, smooth, beautifully crafted.  The elegant legs and carefully inlayed wood.  She longed to pick one up smash it against the wall.  </span></a> – and a hideous and rather uncomfortable <a href="">Victorian sofa<span>It might have been uncomfortable, but she smiled every time she saw it, remembering a rather refreshing afternoon with Jeremy as he bent her over its upholstered arm and very vigorously introduced her to her favourite new parlor game.</span></a>.

The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>Not so in the years that the family gatherings happened. For some reason this was always their haven from Uncle John&#8217;s military style discipline. It was their place to build tents, play with Oupa&#8217;s pipes and listen to scratchy LPs.</span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>Time and again they would hide like naughty school girls behind the ruins of local block houses and listen to the cavorting of the young shepherds and their companions in the night. They always guessed there was more to &#8220;Red at night&#8221;&#8230;</span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>Suzy and I used to run our marbles from side to side. Her on the one end and me on the other. It was a long shot, but the joy of success!</span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>The question was always about the garish frame. Why gold leaf and why the intricacy surrounding such a tranquil scene?</span></a>, <a href="">two samplers<span>The fear of these hung around for years after Aunt Nicea passed away. She used them as punishment for not producing decorations that were up to her standards. To her credit she was always pushing them to improve and it did show in there later schooling. Reflecting on it they couldn&#8217;t help but think that she was living vicariously through their achievements.</span></a>, and <a href="">three needlework pictures<span>His gran had tried her best to teach him the finer details; but somehow he had never mastered the accuracy required to turn needlework into an art form. These were his pride and joy, brimming with his love for the nostalgia of days gone by, though the eclectic colouring was a bit too modern for the themes of the triple ducks flying by. Nobody blamed him for this conceit, since there is always a danger of things going astray if you are colour blind.</span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>All artworks in the making. It was always a competition between the uncles who could produce the best compositions, but the talent was palpable.</span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span>Mahogany crica 1778 with gold leaf inlay in a non-typical asymmetric style with marching chair reupholstered to match the original. Unique and priceless.</span></a>, some little <a href="">satin-wood tables<span>Klondike, freecell, spider, castle, bisley, demon &#8211; to call him a connoisseur would be an understatement of epic proportions. These tables were dedicated to an art form practiced in very few places, an art form of such subtlety that to watch was to dream.</span></a> – and a hideous and rather uncomfortable <a href="">Victorian sofa<span>Now that Gran was no longer around and Miss Daisy was sleeping permanently under the trees there was very little reason to keep it, it is just that no-one had the heart to do anything about it. There was an unwritten agreement to let it just dissolve into nothingness, that was more conceit than wishful thinking.<br />

The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>It had not always been a drawing-room, though a new visitor would never notice this. Madame had ensured the transformation was complete: even the elaborate fireplace and bay window had been torn out and made unrecognisable through the skilful efforts of Mr French and his apprentices. Only the sofa, a Victorian monstrosity without charm or comfort, remained untouched, a jarring reminder of that fateful night.<br />
 </span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>So, one story could be that that little shepherdess, the one with the battered nose and faded skirts, is secretly a princess. The daughter of a powerful, handsome, and talented King, lost in a far away land. One day, he will ride onto the mantelpiece on his fine horse and pick up the little shepherdess with paint-stained hands (in Emily&#8217;s mind, the King is invariably a very fine painter), swing her onto the front of his saddle, and take her far, far away from this dreary drawing-room.<br />
That&#8217;s just one possible story, of course.</span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>Faux-greek columns soared arrogantly around the cavity of the fireplace, filled with meticulously arranged, skillfully dried, artfully lifeless roses. So flammable, Emily often thought. So very flammable.</span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>Dark, mysterious landscapes where twisted roads soar up endless cliffs, and ancient trees reach upwards as if to pierce the firmament. The signature is a twisted scrawl, starting with a &#8220;Z&#8221;. They are very valuable, Madame always says, but she does not sell them.<br />
</span></a>, <a href="">two samplers<span>Both the Gothic and the Cursive Alphabets lack the &#8220;E&#8221;.<br />
Emily has repeatedly apologised for this, but nonetheless she has been banned from any further embroidering by Madame.</span></a>, and <a href="">three needlework pictures<span>Fine works; Madame is acknowledged to have exceptional skill with the needle. They are for Emily&#8217;s dowry, Madame says: &#8220;The Sleepy Cat&#8221;; &#8220;Girls Playing&#8221;. &#8220;A Forest Encounter&#8221;.<br />
Emily tries to be grateful, truly, but she finds the pictures disturbing. In her eyes, they are subtly subversive: the Cat, seemingly dozing in the sun, appears dead to her. And what is that&#8230; thing&#8230; the Girls are so merrily throwing?<br />
The forest thing, hiding in the tree branches, comes to her in her dreams. It is not a pleasant Encounter.</span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>Conrad and Julia Cuttner &#8211; straight-laced and narrow-toothed, just like Auntie Anne.<br />
Richard and Robert Phillis-Smythe &#8211; specially scrubbed for this photo, no doubt, gleaming with gleeful guilt. In the background, Louis the Cat, petrified as per usual.<br />
Gwynneth Smythe &#8211; perfect, polished and marketable. Madame simply <em>adores </em>this photograph.<br />
There are no pictures of Emily, of course.</span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span>A grand old piece, taking more space than the drawing room affords it. It sits, fat, in it corner, glistening in stray sunlight, its surface clear except for that one, elegant volume. Madame&#8217;s diary.<br />
Emily has read it a million times in her imagination. Her mind supplies staggering secrets, weaves clandestine narratives, reveals the truth of the lumpy sofa, the mysterious painter, the unwanted child.<br />
She has never dared touch that desk.</span></a>, some little <a href="">satin-wood tables<span>Refined, sophisticated, delicate.<br />
Madame will probably leave them to Cousin Gwynneth one day.</span></a> – and a hideous and rather uncomfortable <a href="">Victorian sofa<span>It is a summer evening, sixteen years ago. Madame is a young girl, perching on the edge of the lumpy, large sofa. Her soft eyes are locked into the gaze of a young man, handsome, carefree and in love. The house is silent in the setting sun, all potential bastions of propriety and responsibility miraculously drawn away on serendipitous errands. Two hands, one marked with paint, touch: hesitantly, then urgently. Fate, merciless and swift, ties two lives together; and creates a third.<br />
</span></a>.

The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>The strongest memory I have of the drawing room is the smell.<br />
There was a salty sea-like smell, almost a taste. The nearest piece of coastline was more than 60 miles away. The smell began tickling your nostrils a few paces away from the door. Once you entered the room, it became almost sweet. Like the smell of meat just before it turns. The strangest thing was that the smell would stay with my shoes for days afterwards.</span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>They were somewhat cracked and crumbled, much like the host.The two figures shared three hands between them and the legs of the bases were broken: they listed towards each other like drunkards on a street corner on a Saturday night.</span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>If I hadn&#8217;t had to sit through hours of his blathering about it before he had it installed, I would have sworn that the mantelpiece was made of lino. Bargain bin cast offs at that. As it was, I knew that he&#8217;d paid through the nose to have it imported from Balochistan. The stone itself wasn&#8217;t cheap, but the bribes for the Customs officials to turn a blind eye to the boys he was smuggling in with the stone had nearly bankrupted him. &#8220;Worth every penny,&#8221; he had leered at me over a glass of port one night.</span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>The frames at least matched the elegance of the furniture: rich, smooth, wood; crisp lines. The paintings themselves were a different story. The scenes depicted were easily recognisable as various views from the gardens because the house itself was so striking. The technique left something to be desired, however. The flat washes were heavy-handed and the wet in wet looked more like accidents than artistic endeavour.</span></a>, <a href="">two samplers<span>&#8220;ABCDEFGHIJKL<br />

How&#8230; unimaginative.</span></a>, and <a href="">three needlework pictures<span>The most polite way to describe the content of the pictures would be &#8220;unconventional.&#8221; At first glance they seemed innocent enough, but perhaps haphazardly made. Closer inspection revealed something perhaps more sinister: occult symbols and iconography. I never dared to ask directly if the pictures were their equivalent of a crucifix, for fear of a direct answer.</span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>Seventeen. The number of photos he had of his niece and two nephews was now seventeen. The first few that went up felt like he was just the proud uncle. After the tenth one found its place on the the wall it started to become a little odd. Then he started making ever more elaborate frames for them: card; tissue paper; buttons; glitter.I suppose that&#8217;s why he was always hanging around Mrs Williams&#8217; haberdashery as a boy.</span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span>The desk was exquisite: a thing of beauty. It was one of the few things in the house that I coveted. While so many other things were in a state of disrepair (the curtains, the Afghans), he kept the desk in the most mint of conditions.

				<p>Now that Gran was no longer around and Miss Daisy was sleeping permanently under the trees there was very little reason to keep it, it is just that no-one had the heart to do anything about it.

				<p>It is a summer evening, sixteen years ago. Madame is a young girl, perching on the edge of the lumpy, large sofa. Her soft eyes are locked into the gaze of a young man, handsome, carefree and in love. The house is silent in the setting sun, all potential bastions of propriety and responsibility miraculously drawn away on serendipitous errands. Two hands, one marked with paint, touch: hesitantly, then urgently. Fate, merciless and swift, ties two lives together; and creates a third.</p>

				<p>So, one story could be that that little shepherdess, the one with the battered nose and faded skirts, is secretly a princess. The daughter of a powerful, handsome, and talented King, lost in a far away land. One day, he will ride onto the mantelpiece on his fine horse and pick up the little shepherdess with paint-stained hands (in Emily&#8217;s mind, the King is invariably a very fine painter), swing her onto the front of his saddle, and take her far, far away from this dreary drawing-room.</p>

The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>Despite its fancy name it was a small, poorly lit room and rather uninviting. It had once been the entrance hall before the estate was subdivided and the majestic driveway destroyed.</span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>They were a wedding gift from a forgotten relation, placed safely out of reach in the room from which we children were forbidden. In my earliest memories I broke a shepherd’s crook and mended it with desperate, childish clumsiness.  The inevitable punishment never came – in all the intervening years the damage was never noticed. Mother always hated those pale, pastel statues: perhaps that’s why father insisted they always be displayed.<br />
</span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>Dark mahogany: beautiful but chipped at the edges and grimy in the cracks.</span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>Mother was a dedicated amateur artist in the last years of her life. The first, an early attempt at a Strelitzia, is skilful but uninspired. The second, completed in the last years of her life, depicts a stormy beach in late afternoon.  In the far distance three figures walk ankle deep in the froth; another trails far behind wading through deeper water.</span></a>, <a href="">two samplers<span>We did them for mother when we were kids, a craft project. My brother’s sampler is precise and elegant; mine by contrast untidy and childish. They had lain in the bottom of a cupboard for years; it was only long after we had left home that they were framed and put on display.</span></a>, and <a href="">three needlework pictures<span>They have always been here. My mother must have known where they came from and why she kept them but if she ever told me the story I have forgotten it.</span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>There are twelve photos, apparently of my cousins. I recognise eight of them but can only name three. My brother would know them all, he was always more interested in the family.</span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span>It was my mother’s special writing desk – bought, years before, to write her novel from. At fourteen I first managed to pick the lock of the bottom drawer: there was no secret manuscript, just some old passports and a dusty Anias Nin novel.</span></a>, some little <a href="">satin-wood tables<span>Made of exquisuite inlaid wood and always polished to a mirror-sheen: my grand parents brought them back from India in the 30&#8242;s. My brother, before he left, once said they were the only thing in this dreary house that he wanted to inherit.</span></a> – and a hideous and rather uncomfortable <a href="">Victorian sofa<span> I remember my brother, aged nineteen, sobbing wretchedly on that sofa: hopelessly and frustrated. It was one of the last times we spoke.<br />
I told him to just get it over with and tell my parents the truth about himself. I told him once they were over the initial shock everything would be alright. He should have known better than to take the advice of a fifteen year old: they never spoke to him after that day.</p>

				<p>The tables were of such a high quality and craftsmanship that the knitted coasters splayed upon them jarred all the more.<br />
The surfaces were often slightly sticky to the touch, as though they&#8217;d been cleaned in a hurry upon hearing the door bell.</p>

				<p>The strongest memory I have of the drawing room is the smell.<br />
There was a salty sea-like smell, almost a taste. The nearest piece of coastline was more than 60 miles away.<br />
The smell began tickling your nostrils a few paces away from the door.<br />
Once you entered the room, it became almost sweet. Like the smell of meat just before it turns.</p>
<p>The strangest thing was that the smell would stay with my shoes for days afterwards. Nothing else: just my shoes.</p>

				<p>The most polite way to describe the content of the pictures would be &#8220;unconventional.&#8221;<br />
At first glance they seemed innocent enough, but perhaps haphazardly made.<br />
Closer inspection revealed something perhaps more sinister: occult symbols and iconography.<br />
I never dared to ask directly if the pictures were their equivalent of a crucifix, for fear of a direct answer.</p>
