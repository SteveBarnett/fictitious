<p>You find an old lantern in a junk shop one day. You buy it, take it home, polish it up.<br />
Out pops a Genie and offers you three wishes. Your word your requests carefully, so as not to get caught out.<br />
But you do. People always do.</p>
<p>Every few thousand years, the Genie&#8217;s Guild brings together its best and brightest to share stories of Wishers and their Wishes. The best stories, the tales of the most creative and cruel interpretations of a Wish, win the Genie freedom from their lanternic prison. The rest go back to the bottle.</p>
<p>Our job, Fictious folk, is to transcribe the scrolls containing these tales.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 3 weeks.<br />
<strong>Words</strong>: about 500.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[[Original image: security screening at denver airport by Inha Leex Hale on Flickr] Recent years have seen a massive increase in our safety when taking international flights. Pornoscanners have stopped The Terrorists taking chainsaws onto planes. Moving our bottles of liquids into zip lock bags has meant that planes have been keep dry enough. Taking our laptops out of their bags before having them scanned has stopped&#8230; um&#8230; some bad things. Collectively, this family of measures is called Security Theatre. &#8230; <a href="http://fictitious.co.za/2011/10/11/cautionary-tales-from-the-security-theatre/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
