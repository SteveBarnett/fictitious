				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was in a bad mood that day. Worse than usual, I mean. I had been there on my own for what felt like decades. It&#8217;s always hard to tell the exact passing of time when you&#8217;re inside, isn&#8217;t it? It feels like that edge between being asleep and awake: not quite on either side.<br />
I understanded that I needed to be punished. I deserved a less spacious cage. But at least when I was in a lamp I was moving around in the world quite a lot. And sometimes you can sense other Djinn nearby. You ever get that? Like a tingling in your fingertips. If you were corporeal, I mean.</p>
<p>Where was  I? Ah, yes: bad mood. I needed to grant some wishes. I was feeling rough around the edges. Bad comedown. Then I sensed him. A bit flat and flavourless maybe, but better than nothing. He must have been quite determind: once I was out, I could see that the weather was rough. Gale force winds, rain hammering down. But, he made it to the door of my lighthouse. He didn&#8217;t even try to peer through the porthole, just peeled off a glove and rubbed at it.</p>
<p>I welcomed the familiar sting of it as I twisted and turned my way into the flesh that had formed itself up from the stone and moss. I have a theory about the bodies we use, by the way. Something to do with spare wishes, balancing of energies from retractions, things like that. Later, though. More details later. I opened the door to my bland friend.</p>
<p>He stared at me. Looked me up and down.<br />
&#8220;Three, correct? Anything I want?&#8221;<br />
It had been a long time since I&#8217;d had one of those. Usually I needed to do some parlour tricks as a convincer.<br />
&#8220;Aye.&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Three.&#8221; I lit my pipe.</p>
<p>I played the old one, two, switch on him. No surprises for the first two. He got what he asked for. Got him feeling comfortable for the last big wish. The finale. The blockbuster.<br />
&#8220;I want to be connected. I want to feel connected. To the world.&#8221;<br />
I nodded and told him to close his eyes. Completely unnecessary of course, but I like to keep the showmanship going. I licked my thumb and pushed it gently against his forehead. The air crackled with static as I broke his body down into bits and bytes. I pushed his conciousness into the Internet, into telephone networks.<br />
I left him feel every cut of data being chopped into packets. I let him feel the crunch of the data colliding at the end of each journey. I let him feel the stretch of being pulled half way around the world, then back again.</p>
<p>I just had time for a quick chuckle and a glance up at the Fresnel lens before I stung out of the flesh, back to the aether.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first card fluttered onto the table, feather-light. “A simple opening”, said Abdul Ibn Hassan, resplendent in red. On the face of the card, a lone bird floated in an endless sky. “I wish I could fly”, it whispered in a young woman’s voice. It looked at us bitterly. “She missed her next two wishes, too”, added Abdul. “Bird brains, you know.”</p>
<p>We nodded. A traditional start, but that is what I was expecting. Fakir Rabdan, floating on his cloud of golden dust, drew the next card from his curling beard. It clinked like falling coins. On it, a beautiful young man looked into a mirror, hands raised to his face. He shimmered, gleamed, shone, but did not move. “I wish to be beautiful, and rich!” cried a young voice. “Everything I touch should turn to gold”. Fakir smiled, teeth like diamonds. “You bait them with your frippery, Fakir!” protested Abdul, smiling. But that, we knew, was allowed.</p>
<p>“Your turn, Safik!”</p>
<p>I knew to start low. It would not do, to overplay my hand this early in the game. The stakes were too high.</p>
<p>A guitar riff, a drum beat. My card vibrated with unheard rhythms. Thousands of teenage girls raised up pictures of a man with straggly blond hair and smudged eyeliner. They  cried and screamed as a coffin was carried through crowded streets. “I want to be famous” sang a rough voice, wistfully.</p>
<p>The others looked at me quizzically. “The most famous ones are always dead”, I explained. The card shivered, but stayed.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>And so we played.</p>
<p>We brought dead loved ones back to life: Abdul made them soulless and ravenous, Fakir left them buried alive. I had them kidnapped by secret agents and experimented on.</p>
<p>We granted immortality: The cards showed wizened, shrunken ancients;  walking skeletons; soulless cyborgs.</p>
<p>We offered happiness: mindless idiocy, delusional schizophrenia. Grinning maniacs frozen in eternal ecstasy.</p>
<p>The points racked up, in their secret ways, in complicated combinations. We all felt the game’s tides change again and again as the super-strong crushed their lovers, men stepped on the moon and could not find breath to ask for air, women asked for beauty and were disowned by their families. Round and round we went, each hoping it would be our turn to win.</p>
<p>The game is played for the highest stakes.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>“The end game, my dear friends”, announced Fakir finally, stroking his silver beard. He was in the lead: his last card, a city trapped in a perfect day, doomed to relive it again and again, never changing, still glowed faintly atop the tall pile on the table.</p>
<p>Abdul carefully removed one last card from his crimson turban. He smiled his sly smile as he laid it down. “Peace on Earth” asked a sweet voice from within.  A soft glow touched every being in the world. For one small moment no creature harmed another. It was as if the world held its breath.</p>
<p>The moment passed, and violence resumed. “Peace on Earth” laughed Abdul. “How about that!” He was right to laugh. He was in the lead now.</p>
<p>Fakir, pale and drawn, reached into the recesses of his kaftan. He presented his last card. It hovered and twirled in the air over the table. “Total control over reality” said a confident voice. The air inside the card stood still. “He needs to move individual molecules to get anything to happen”, explained Fakir. A man was frozen, helpless, in the middle of his card. Fakir beamed; his lead was restored.</p>
<p>My opponents turned to me. “The last move is yours, Safik.” Fakir’s lead over me was vast. “Even if you cannot win, you must play”, Abdul reminded me. Those are the rules of this ancient game, a game played for the highest stake: one jinn’s freedom.</p>
<p>I drew my last card out from my heart, where I hid my greatest secrets. It showed a young man in torn jeans rubbing an ancient oil lamp. A jinn emerged, majestic and blue. The scene was silent, but jinn and man talked or a long while, with much scratching of heads and waving of hands. Finally, they shook hands.</p>
<p>“I wish to become the Jinn, Safik Al Shahad, and take his place in the lamp”, said a young voice, resounding clean and clear all around us. The card swelled, grew.</p>
<p>Turned itself inside out.</p>
<p>Comprehension dawned on the red face, then the golden one. The game was won. I felt myself lifting up from the table, away from my lamp, free at last. I looked down on myself and saw my old, torn jeans.</p>
<p>I was back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it difficult to trick a spoilt prince into self destruction? What art is needed to lead a wise man filled with curiosity to his doom? Does it take a great skill to destroy true love’s purity? These are easy entertainments: the seeds of destruction written clear for all to see.</p>
<p>In the year 1099AD I sought such morsels of amusement at the walls of Jerusalem. I gazed down upon the thronging crowds of desperate men, dying far from home and sick with bloodlust, and I smiled at the abundance. That is when I first saw Samuel Dimante moving among the Christian lines. To my unnatural sight he shone: a calm, compassionate, thinking man unaffected by the raging torrents of hatred and lust that mortals call war. I saw a man of grace and honour; a healer and a priest standing uncorrupted amongst the horrors of his kind. I saw a fine opportunity.</p>
<p>I stood by him as he prayed for victory on a quiet knoll in the evening. ‘Just ask and it will be so’, I say too close to his ear. With the usual injunctions he turned on me, swearing to pay no heed to my deceitful talk. I laughed quietly in the dark, why would I deceive when the truth would suffice?</p>
<p>‘Your prayers will be answered and not by my hand: the Saracen cannot hold another day. Jerusalem will fall on the morrow. In your heart you know this, your commanders know it and the soldiers feel it in their blood.  Tomorrow all that has been suffered will be avenged. Tomorrow Christian men will ravage victorious through the streets of Jerusalem bringing God’s fierce retribution to the starving infidels within. At last those who have stood against your church will be brought to swift and savage justice – blood will run on the steps of the Temple of Solomon.’</p>
<p>‘In the morning, Sir, I will return to hear your prayers’</p>
<p>I was loathe to leave him that night but thoughtful men need time to think. And there was play enough to distract me: a young knight willing to trade his companion’s lives so that he could return to his lover alive – he should have said ‘alive and whole’. But when the dawn began to lighten the sky I had not forgotten Samuel Dimante and I stood beside him at his morning prayers.</p>
<p>‘Lord, should the walls, by your grace, fall today, let each soldier as he touches Jerusalem’s holy ground feel your compassionate grace. Give them the knowledge that all mankind are brothers in your sight &#8211; let them see only the pure souls within as you do and not the outwards trappings of belief. Amen.’</p>
<p>As he finished he slowly opened his eyes and looked straight into mine. Quietly I echoed his Amen and, with a slight smile, disappeared.</p>
<p>After the east bastion fell Samuel was among the first to penetrate the narrow city streets. All was chaos then: no man could tell Saracen from Christian, none could tell friend from foe. There was no ally to defend your back and no enemy before you; there was nought but angry, violent men filled with fear and battle-lust.</p>
<p>Mortal histories say the street of Jerusalem flowed ankle deep in blood that day in an orgy of violence rarely matched. Samuel was among the few survivors that day – he lived till old age in dark regret. That was not my doing, perhaps his God chose to spare him?</p>
