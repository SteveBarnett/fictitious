				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi people; fuck it’s so good to be back. It’s been a hectic three weeks. I swear I’ve never been so tired.  I’ve been counting the hours till I could get here and just relax with you lot.</p>
<p>The days I’ve been putting in are incredible: sixteen hours on your feet in the sun and the climate there is something else. No seriously, it starts at like five am: my kids (the same kids who won’t get out of bed at seven for school) want to horse ride on the beach with me; or go kayaking on the fucking bay to watch the sunrise (which is just like sunset but with more glare and less colour). And that’s before the first cup of coffee.</p>
<p>As the day wears on it just gets hotter and it just never stops: adventure sports, cultural activities, local colour and posing for photographs. And, luxury resort or not, every little thing is made intentionally more difficult: the money isn’t dollars, they drive on the wrong side and the menus aren’t in English.</p>
<p>And when the kids finally pass out it still isn’t over. It must be something about the sun and sea but the wife never lets up, come midnight she&#8217;s still got a plan for me.</p>
<p>I tell you guys this is the first time in three weeks that I can do whatever I want for eight hours. Boy, it&#8217;s good to be back at work again.</p>
