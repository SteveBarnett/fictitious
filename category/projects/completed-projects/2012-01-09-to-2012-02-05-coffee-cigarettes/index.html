				<p>“Look, I know you don’t really want to be here. It’s awkward for me too. But I think it’s important.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I just… I just want a chance to say my piece and then I won’t bother you again. I promise. Does that sound okay?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I have to admit: you’re not what I expected. Taller, for one. Smarter. Dressed smarter, I mean. That’s a great suit. Where did you get it? It doesn’t matter. It’s probably more than I could afford anyway. Me? Postman. Delivering the mail. See: I’ve the bag and everything. I know that almost everything’s electronic these days, but you’d be surprised how much stuff still gets sent through the post. Weird stuff too. The other day I – Oh! Here you come. No more practising.”</p>
<p>“Hi. You must be… Peter, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Yes, that’s me. Peter, yes. Pleased to meet, very pleased.”</p>
<p>“That’s great, Peter, great. You can let go of my hand now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry, yes. Yes! Right you are. Sorry. Yes.”</p>
<p>“No problem. Let’s sit, shall we?”</p>
<p>“Yes. After you. Please. Let me get your chair.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Waiter? Double espresso and a tea. Quickly, please. I see the transplant took well, Peter. Here you are, bouncing around.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to say… thank you. You saved my life.”</p>
<p>“That’s very kind, but perhaps a little bit of an exaggeration. I wasn’t using my soul; you needed one. I saw it as more of a business transaction.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but now you’ll go to Hell. And I’ll go to Heaven. For ever.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that will be a problem. Let’s just say I have friends in… low places.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t suppose you do. Ah, my coffee, excellent. May I smoke here?”</p>

				<p>“Mrs Hobson I assume”</p>
<p>“Ah. Mr Johnson, please sit down”</p>
<p>“A most interesting location you have chosen for this meeting, my dear. And in a language the locals can understand – it’s no wonder your lot are considered eccentric.”</p>
<p>“This negotiation concerns them; it’s outcome will determine the continued existence of everything they have ever known. They have, I believe Mr Johnson, a right to listen.”</p>
<p>“Still, inappropriate to our meeting. It might remind this lowly civil servant of his duty – and that would act against your cause.”</p>
<p>“You are here – you have no sense of duty. Anyhow I like the novelty of bipedalism and the vocalisations have a certain rustic gusto, don’t you think? Another espresso Mr Johnson?”</p>
<p>“I would prefer to get right to business. As I understand it you require me to survey the Sol System as ‘Devoid of Life’ so as to more easily acquire a C-class demolition permit for the surrounding reach. Is that the gist of it Mrs Hobson?”</p>
<p>“For which I will pay you four hundred Cesari pure by anonymous transfer.”</p>
<p>“I have further requirements, these long survey trips create domestic difficulties. I require a paid vacation to Belruga Playspace for my mates and I.”</p>
<p>“What, all of them?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately tradition dictates only the primary seventy-seven should be taken on a trip of this nature.”</p>
<p>“Well that seems fair enough Mr Johnson – I believe we have a deal.  Let’s spit and shake hands on that: it’s how they do it here.”</p>

“What?”<br />
“Same as yesterday. Cold. Too cold. Look at it.”<br />
“What? Looks like coffee. It’s coffee.”<br />
“It’s not just coffee. It’s my coffee, and it’s fucking cold. Again. Just like yesterday. And the day before.”<br />
“Are you going to make a scene? Shall I come back in a few minutes?”<br />
“No, stay right there, I’m going to sort this out and we can get down to it.”<br />
“So, it all picks up speed from Wednesday, when we have six of them coming in. Fresh off the blocks, too, so you&#8217;ll have your work cut out for you. Be gentle with them this time. Thursday has another five, mid-range this time. Friday’s a bit slower and &#8211; you’re not even listening are you?”<br />
“Hmm, no. I mean yes. Wednesday six little ones, Thursday five at half mast, Friday slow. There he is.”<br />
“Who?”<br />
“The waiter. Must have been hiding in the kitchen. Hey! Here. Yes, over here.”<br />
“Jesus, make it quick, will you?”<br />
“Hi. I’m afraid this coffee’s no good. Here, pick it up. See? Cold. Too cold. You can hold the cup for more than a few seconds. That means it’s too cold. Bring me a hot one, won’t you? There’s a good chap. Let’s see how he does this time.”<br />
“I don’t know how people put up with you. Still living on your own?”<br />
“I like my freedom.”<br />
“Why do you keep coming here if the coffee’s so bad?”<br />
“Haven’t I told you before? It’s wonderful for eavesdropping. Best way for people in our line of work to pick up business.”</p>

<p>“You look good – fit and healthy”</p>
<p>“Ja man – I run three k’s  every morning”</p>
<p>“Seriously ,  you – the x-box champion!”</p>
<p>“Every day – weekends too – I get up and run at six. It’s a great way to start the day.”</p>
<p>“Jus. When I knew you, you could barely walk up the two blocks to buy cigs without puffing.  I can’t believe you’re this seriously fit oke now. I mean you, a computer geek: what suddenly inspired you to start running man – that’s plain weird.”</p>
<p>“Well I met this girl&#8230;.”</p>
<p>“You started running at 6am for a girl! You were love-struck baby, love-struck. And you always made out like you were way above that shit in school.”</p>
<p>“Naah, no man, no it wasn’t like that – I mean not after the first time. I was already basically living at her place, and she runs like once a week, so one day I go along with her just for fun and it nearly kills me but she’s very encouraging, you know – very encouraging.  And we discovered that it’s a really good time.”</p>
<p>“For what? A shower?”</p>
<p>“Well not that day, we didn’t get as far as the shower we just screwed in the hallway as soon as we got the door closed. It’s fantastic man – you’re both hot and sweaty and hyped up on adrenalin: it brings out all the wild every fucking morning man – it’s fantastic!”</p>
