				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thomas was going through a shoe phase. A year ago it had been vacuum cleaners, but this week it was shoes that engaged his entire attention. He had already spent the greater part of this journey intently examining the workings of the buckle on his mother’s flats – hard, shiny brass against the wrinkled, twisted tan leather strap.</p>
<p>But now he had noticed the shiny black shoes across the carriage, with long, enticing laces neatly tied, on the feet of the man with the animal face. But every time he wondered over his mother would drag him back and give him a hard look: it was very frustrating.</p>
<p>When the weird lady with the tattoos drops something he leaps out, his mother can hardly chide him for being helpful.</p>

<p>She is unable to resist. She feels him, radiating heat, pulsating like a bulge in reality. This is why she is on this train, this is why she needs to bear the erupting teenager, the clumsy slut, the stinking drunk. To catch a devil.</p>
<p>She turns to the blind man beside her like she would to her family confessor. &#8220;Some things are fated, do you understand?&#8221; He nods, turning his sightless eyes towards her. &#8220;But there is honour in trying to resist such fate, isn&#8217;t there?&#8221; he answers. They pretend this talk is about the travelsick young man.</p>
<p>The Comtessa imagines resisting fate. She remembers a blind man&#8217;s meticulous touch, the precision of it. She pretends to have the luxury of choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you&#8221;, she whispers to the blind man. Then she stands up, feeling the weight of her family, her clan, her coven all upon her again. &#8220;Mr Mestopheles, I believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Black eyes burn through her. A cold, perfect hand takes hers.</p>
<p>Tonight, she will be devoured by the devil.</p>

My feet are firmly planted on the ground, so he is the one that falls.<br />
&#8220;Jesus Christ, look where you&#8217;re going,&#8221; he shouts and slurs at me.<br />
&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; I say, smiling down at him angelically. I offer him a hand to help him back to his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;m the other one.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every time I decide to do it the world undermines me. All my life people have told me I’m a fighter but that’s obvious to anyone who understands my disease. There are only two kinds of CF sufferers: the fighters and the suicides. This month it was, at last, time to change sides: I have closed my accounts, settled my will and written my eulogy.</p>
<p>But this simple train ride undermines me.</p>
<p>It was that vomiting guy that started it – he actually looked worst than I feel most days – I felt for him. First I was reminded that I’ve never danced on a public train and then that kid came in through the window. He looked so alive; like his head was about to explode with the sheer rush of it. It seems stupid to die without trying that.</p>
<p>Before we reach the station I’m a fighter again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s this damn train, isn&#8217;t it, this damn so-called public transport &#8220;system&#8221;, ha! A system needs to function to deserve that name.</p>
<p>Enough. I close my eyes and pretend to sleep, but actually I&#8217;m doing my breathing mantra and regulating my heart rate. I&#8217;m getting pretty good at it, I think.</p>
<p>What the heck is going on there, now? I just bloody hope no-one pulls the emergency brake, I would totally lapse my anger management principles on their ass. Oh God, cops? Can this day get any more unbalanced? If I had an aura (I&#8217;m still undecided about that) it would be turning black right now.</p>
<p>Ouch! What the &#8211; is someone shooting or something? That was sore, not like bullet sore, like a kick in the chest sore. What the hell?</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s stopped. A kind woman I had not noticed before comes up to me. &#8220;You look much better now&#8221;, she says, and I do feel better, better than ever. I take her hand.</p>
<p>Behind me, my lifeless head slowly tilts to rest on an unsuspecting shoulder. I look peaceful.</p>
<p>I nearly don&#8217;t recognise myself.</p>

But I&#8217;m calm. Sitting with my man. Just taking it easy.</p>
<p>Whoa!<br />

<p>The air suddenly gets cold around us. That&#8217;s weird. I lick my nose reflexively, scratch my ear.<br />
<a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/fictitious.co.za/2011/09/17/susan-hampton/" title="Susan Hampton">That lady</a> looks kind of funny. Sort of like a cat. Here, but not here. She&#8217;s smiling, though, so I smile back at her as our eyes meet.</p>

He&#8217;s a good boss.<br />
I wonder where we&#8217;ll go today?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trucker sat next to Victoria once. None of us believed it, but he&#8217;s got a pic and all. Said David was away, she was feeling lonely, riding the train, to find someone to talk to, like.</p>
<p>So Trucker says. The pic looks real, anyways.</p>
<p>But me, I never gets to sit to no-one famous. You&#8217;d think all of them TV stars is too important for the miracle of public transport, or something. Probably have their own train, like. Or, you know, a limo.</p>
<p>So anyways, this bloke next to me. Man, I swear that&#8217;s Neville Noon. That&#8217;s what I call a dilemma, now. I have all his books. I&#8217;m nearly pissing in my pants. But can I ask for a picture? What am I gonna tell my mates: &#8220;That&#8217;s Neville Noon that is, he&#8217;s like brilliant, he&#8217;s the next Stephen King?&#8221; Man, those guys like struggle to make out the punchline on Andy Capp. Crap.</p>
<p>Oh, what the fuck: &#8220;Look, mate, sorry to bother, but are you like maybe &#8211; &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s me, love&#8221;, interrupts this sunburnt geezer, jumping up, doing like air guitar or something. Fucking up my whole approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the fuck are you, Grandad?&#8221; Geez.</p>

<p>He sits, rocking slightly with the movement of the train, in the corner seat. An echoing thrup-thrup means they’re switched from the main track and he feels the driver ease up on the power: approaching a station. He wonders which window that kid bashing around on the roof is going choose for his grand entrance.</p>
<p>Despite the drunkard’s reek he smells an Italian countess: the perfect floral notes speak of perfume over priced and over applied. It intrigues him. Just as he is intrigued by the woman who smells of fear and goat’s blood and whose clothes rustled so strangely.</p>
<p>Martin loves train travel: it’s intriguing for a blind man.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can never be too careful. Not if you don&#8217;t want to be seen. It&#8217;s rush hour, right? Lots of people. Lots of eyes.<br />
So I went a bit more full-on than usual.<br />
Moustache, yes, of course.<br />
Sunglasses. Classic Ray-Bans.<br />
Hat. Fedora. I prefer a Trilby, looks nicer, but the forehead coverage isn&#8217;t so good. You can&#8217;t beat a Fez for comedy value, but it&#8217;s hardly low key, is it?<br />
Trench coat, black. Discreet. Sharp.</p>
<p>Oh, shit. I think I&#8217;ve been made. I guess with the reunion tour on, it&#8217;s to be expected.<br />
<a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/fictitious.co.za/2011/09/18/winnifred-jenkins/">The woman across from me</a> looks like she&#8217;s about to ask for my autograph. She&#8217;s got a pen and paper at the ready. She&#8217;s been talking to herself for a few minutes. Must be rehearsing what she&#8217;ll say. I&#8217;ve seen fans do it before.<br />
So I stand up, fling the disguise off, do the sign of the horns. Fans love that.<br />
&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s me, love,&#8221; I nod to Miss Secretary. &#8220;No pushing, hey,&#8221; I say, pointing at <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/fictitious.co.za/2011/09/11/jack-flash/">window-crashing Sk8r Boi</a>.<br />
&#8220;Who the fuck are you, Grandad?&#8221;</p>
