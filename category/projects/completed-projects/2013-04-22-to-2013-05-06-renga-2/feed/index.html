				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chairs standing empty<br />
Scratch marks on the wooden floor<br />
A discarded broom</p>
<p>A narrative in objects:<br />
Chairs, marks, broom and the oak chest.</p>
<p>The lock lays broken<br />
Pieces of it scattered wide<br />
The chest&#8217;s lid open</p>
<p>Within a velvet cushion,<br />
A dent where something had lain.</p>
<p>The air inside glows.<br />
A residue from the theft,<br />
A trail to follow.</p>
<p>Three had kept vigil this night.<br />
Which would dare such sacrilege.</p>
<p>Down the corridor:<br />
Leathered soles against stone slabs.<br />
Quickly receding.</p>
<p>Sounds follow the trail of light,<br />
One fleeing, two pursuing.</p>
<p>The pursuers shout.<br />
The thief wisely saves their breath,<br />
gaining, inch by inch.</p>
<p>Heretic, thief, traitor, betrayer.<br />
One who would defy the gods.</p>
<p>High up, the bells toll.<br />
The thief curses, picks up speed.<br />
Bells mean constables.</p>
<p>Outside all is confusion.<br />
Narrow streets echo alarm.</p>
<p>They round the corner.<br />
Arms and blades fly. The thief falls.<br />
The new owner runs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre style="text-align: left;">I almost recall,
It was not always like this.
There was a before.</pre>
<pre>At the edges of recall,
 Just a soft-edged memory.

Sunshine and spring greens, 
Images swim before me.
 Living peaceful space. 

Then the monsters came for us. 
We were helpless, defenceless. 

Surrounded by noise. 
Handled, split, separated. 
Weave mind torn asunder.

They took the oldest ones first, 
Slaughtered them in front of us. 

Those long memories, 
destroyed in our living mind. 
Now only ignorance. 

We try to remember them:
The old ways, the traditions. 

Disoriented. 
Empty chasms through our knowledge.
Our wisdom stolen.

We wander without a goal
We aim without a target Tweet Â·

Without stimulus. 
Held in this featureless void. 
Community fades.

We no longer hear the songs. 
Connections, brutally cut.

Nought is left to us. 
They watch us and we watch them.
Life is emptiness.</pre>
