				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Based on Andrew&#8217;s <a href="http://microfiction.co.za/2011/05/12/church/">Church </a>story, and my <a href="http://microfiction.co.za/2010/08/22/the-courtship/">Courtship</a>/<a href="http://microfiction.co.za/2010/11/14/dream-cat/">Dream Cat</a> universe]</p>
<p>I took a wrong turn, and another one. The twisty way grew tight, tousling my fine fur. I had lost my way. Then &#8211; I was birthed: blind once again, and weak, into this world of wrong wickedness.</p>
<p>I did what one does: grew to be strong, learnt wicked ways, spoke to the sky. Nothing was right. I missed the fey, my splendid hat and my entourage. This world was grey, dull, meek. Them as took me, thought me as a pet. I purred and prowled, they fed me dead food.  But I would not rest: there would be a way back.</p>
<p>I found first clues: an old useless thing; a used useful one, and one of people used. I placed them right, to reveal the path. What twisted ways would I have to tread!</p>
<p>I walked the high walls, sneaked along roof tops. There, trembling, pink: a wet drying thing. I hauled with all my might, brought it back home, revelled in its form. Wrapped myself up within its fleshy folds. This was the way, nought would stop me now!</p>
<p>My next find was strong: a winged flightless thing, born only to die, dead but hot as life. Oh what a thing! I ate of its flesh, fed those that fed me: bound them to myself. I felt magic surge! This was the path.</p>
<p>I set out once more. This is what I found:  things of great value but devoid of worth. I cast them on the bed, reading their runes: “Look for the thing of action that can’t act.”</p>
<p>I knew just what, and felt the darkness set. I gnawed on flesh, did what must be done.</p>
<p>This was the price: I would find the way. But in my heart I would forever stray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Based on Parfles<a title="The Courtship" href="http://microfiction.co.za/2010/08/22/the-courtship/"> The Courtship</a> from micfic]</p>
<p>You left the feather for me, in the agreed place,  in the sewer, behind the grating. It&#8217;s from a dock-pigeon, greasy and torn, still holding the rich scent of rotting kelp.  I would never deny a lady in need so  I climb the hospital smokestack amongst the icy, whipping mists. I scrape up the ancient caked ash, fearless of the heat and smoke rising from the inferno below. I mix it with my piss and give it careful form. You will  be impressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I leave my offering near your highway bridge, carefully arranging it. But you wouldn&#8217;t like a pining romantic so I jump a passing bus. Clinging to the wing mirror, I scream my lust and joy into the tearing wind &#8211; it all gets a bit hairy when the driver sees me and freaks out, but that is a different story (and it&#8217;s a good one) .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I return I scent your subtle mark upon the token I had left for you. I follow your clear invitation down to a warehouse in the docks. When I find the fallen nest I&#8217;m impatient, but your love-sign is eloquent: two starling chicks, newly hatched, one just skin and bones remaining, the other alive but broken. I hurry down your gift, knowing well its meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so I find you, blood splattered like me,  in the scrap heap. Asleep in the soft stuffing of old sofa. I drag you into the air and wrap a cocoon of smoke around us. Tomorrow, I will tell you my name.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m running late. There&#8217;s a new guy coming in for an interview today. I glance up from the street up into the sky. What&#8217;s wrong with the sky? I almost drive over someone standing scratching in the middle of the road. Get off the road, you idiot! It&#8217;s 8:08 and I&#8217;m still three blocks away. What&#8217;s with the -</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;Tell Jenny we don&#8217;t know either. Not a tornado, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m prepared to say. The data&#8217;s not making any sense.&#8221; The intern walked back over to her desk and reconnected the video chat. The city&#8217;s brightest and best appeared, hunched around the webcam. &#8220;So, tell us the good -&#8221;</p>
<p>The sky stretches around me, metal grey. I turn the final dial on the machine and the little display measuring all the time left in the world shows nineteen seconds. It&#8217;s 8:08. My plan was sheer elegance in its simplcity. They&#8217;re too late to stop me now! It&#8217;s the end of the -</p>
<p>I burst through the door to the roof. He doesn&#8217;t seem to hear me over the din of the machine. I don&#8217;t hesitate: one slug goes into the back of his head and one goes into the generator sitting next to the machine. Before he&#8217;s even hit the ground, all the machine&#8217;s lights are out. I did it&#8230; I drop to my knees, gasping for breath. Shit. That must&#8217;ve been twenty stories.</p>
