				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My mother was a throwback, a person from a different time &#8211; the final rebel in humanity&#8217;s smallest generation. They all made her pay for it of course: most with ostracism, but some with their compassionate understanding of her moral weakness. After her suicide they told me to rejoice that she had finally found moral clarity.</p>
<p>I was alone after that. But I had always been the only child: I was used to being alone.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just my mother’s pro-humanist beliefs that were anachronistic, almost all her out-time was spent researching the twenty-first century: text works , flatties, old reality-stores, music  and whatever other junk she could lay her hands on. I grew up with that stuff all around; and I have to tell you: those pre-rational folk were obsessed with their own deaths.</p>
<p>Any disaster imaginable was played out in their fiction: nuclear war, biological agents, the sun going super nova, rising sea levels, catastrophic climate change, monsters from the deep and alien invaders. I spent my childhood watching those ancient flatties, disaster films they called them. Their far-fetched dooms were so romantic, their heroes so brave in the face of annihilation.</p>
<p>But they never imagined the truth, not a single surviving work of fiction from their time predicts the Restoration Movement. Until recently I had assumed the idea of voluntary extinction was completely beyond their moral reach, but I found an old store in my mother’s stuff: a semantically indexed copy of their &#8216;internet&#8217; (a PubStorage precursor). I learnt a few things. I read about those at Masada who chose death out of principle a thousand years before. I read first of their suicide cults and later of death cults and I realised it was more than just their fiction, they felt it in their hearts &#8211; already they wished for the peace of absence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I also found VHEMT, the ‘Voluntary Human Extinction Movement’, founded in the late twentieth century. I suppose it was a kind of joke, an idea more than anything else, intended to be thought provoking, certainly not world changing.  Its authors may not have taken it seriously but they understood the first question of the Restoration, &#8220;Would it be better if we weren&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they were the first to look with rational eyes and answer: &#8220;Yes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was two centuries before those ideas really took hold: the culture of parenting ran. It’s hard to remember that in the beginning the Restorationists were the freaks, their ideas threatening, and the breeders were the vast amoral majority. For years even non-violent Restorationist groups were persecuted but the truth of their basic beliefs couldn’t be repressed. Humanity had lifted its gaze above mere survival and found a greater measure against which to judge its actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After forests and the wolves had returned to Europe it was easier – we had caught a glimpse of the post-restoration world and in it we had seen absolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the youngest of the last generation and our species will end not like an old flattie: there will be no screaming terror; no heroic last stand; nor any outpost of hopeful survivors. We will leave this place in the quiet knowledge that in our final wisdom we have striven to be better than we might have been.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Court recording #32YYT1.B</p>
<p>In attendance: Honourable Judge Augustus Dreyer (AD); The Defendant, Mr Milo Miernik (MM); His Counsel, Advocate Howard Hetter (HH); and State Prosecutor, Genevra Rays (GR).</p>
<p>AD: “And how does the defendant plead?”</p>
<p>HH: “Your Honour, my client, Mr Miernik, pleads innocent. The damage was clearly self-inflicted.”</p>
<p>AD: “A suicide. Indeed. Well, have a seat, everyone. Prosecution, the floor is yours.”</p>
<p>GR: “Prosecution enters Exhibit A.”</p>
<p>AD: “Thank you, Ms Rays. Let the record show that Exhibit A is a blackened lump of uncertain composition, approximately 15cm in diameter. Ms Rays?”</p>
<p>GR: “Your Honour, evidence is going to be very thin on the ground given the nature of the crime. Exhibit A represents the largest remnant of the victim we have been able to find. May I now question the Defendant?”</p>
<p>AD: “Please, go ahead.”</p>
<p>GR: “Mr Miernik, where were you on the evening of March 8<sup>th</sup>?”</p>
<p>MM: “I was in Orchard Grove, Chicago. Visiting Al Robinson at his home.”</p>
<p>GR: “What was the reason for your visit?”</p>
<p>MM: “I was introducing myself to my new neighbour. I had just moved into the area.”</p>
<p>GR: “What transpired during your visit?”</p>
<p>MM: “Robinson was in real estate, so we bonded about that, you know? It’s a tough gig.”</p>
<p>GR: “Mr Miernik, for the record: did you have an interest in Mr Robinson’s property?”</p>
<p>HH: “Objection, this was clearly a social visit! Mr Miernik’s work assignments surely have nothing to do with&#8230;”</p>
<p>AD: “Denied. We are working on a motive here, Hetter. Mr Miernik, answer the question.”</p>
<p>MM: “It’s fine, Howard&#8230; My company, Universal Reality, is indeed very interested in a number of properties in the area.”</p>
<p>GR: “Did you discuss this with Mr Robinson?”</p>
<p>MM: “No, it was just a social call.”</p>
<p>GR: “So you did not offer him anything?”</p>
<p>MM: “I did loan him a number of items, if that is what you are driving at. Neighbourly like.”</p>
<p>GR: “Would you list those items please?”</p>
<p>MM: “Let’s see&#8230; A Level 7 Teleporter. A compact atomic “Annihilator” Raygun. An antimatter conversion engine, Level 5. And a Dimensional Shift Generator, Black Hole powered, very nice.”</p>
<p>GR: “Your Honour, let it be entered that analysis of Exhibit A is consistent with the use of the above items in conjunction with one another.”</p>
<p>MM: “Well, that was a bit silly of him&#8230;”</p>
<p>GR: “Mr Miernik, why did you hand these advanced artefacts to Mr Robinson?”</p>
<p>MM: “ Let’s see. He complained about his commute&#8230; he worried about the crime&#8230; he said he hated clutter&#8230; and needed to clear leaves off his driveway. Yes, that’s about it. Just being helpful.”</p>
<p>GR: “Mr Miernik! Exhibit A is all that remains of Earth! Robinson blew up his planet! Are you denying that you had planned this all along? Are you aware that Universal Reality is already filing plans for a hyperspace bypass through the Sol System?”</p>
<p>MM: “My company is of course taking advantage of the unfortunate accident. That’s just good business, Ms Ray. You can’t deny that the damage was clearly locally inflicted. I was just &#8211; being a good neighbour. ”</p>
<p>GR: &#8220;Prosecution rests, Your Honour.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all saw The Event happen. The half of the world that was asleep woke up, and felt compelled to step outside and tilt our heads back. It was there for just about a second: a sharp green light taking up the whole sky, like a bubble or a dome. Then it was gone. We don&#8217;t know who or what caused it, except that it wasn&#8217;t us. People, I mean. There was some grainy footage of The Event, CCTV cameras and such, but nothing that offered anything new. Nothing that showed us something that we hadn&#8217;t seen that night, standing in the garden in our pajamas, staring open-mouthed up at the sky.</p>
<p>We spent the first week trying to figure out what it was. How did that flash happen? Where did it come from? Why did everyone wake up? Then we became nervous and started asking more: what had it done? We tried to look for any aftereffects of The Event, but the search was too broad; we didn&#8217;t know where to start of what to look for. Did we check us? Or animals? How about crops? What about rocks, soil, the sea? I guess it&#8217;s not surprising that we didn&#8217;t notice for a while: the spread of the effect was too broad. Looking back, I guess I expected someone in a white lab coat, horn rim glasses, and a clipboard to come on the news and tell us about &#8220;A disturbance in The Force&#8221; and what we could do to fix it. Instead, we&#8217;re just around the corner from all these big changes, and we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen to us. To the planet.</p>
<p>It was the little things at first; things that you could explain away, didn&#8217;t take much notice of. Food seemed to go off faster than it should, however you stored it. Ice seemed to melt faster, whatever the temperature of the room. Flavours seemed duller, weaker. Cars stalled in the middle of highways and refused to start again. Computers became less reliable, if they worked at all.</p>
<p>Then we started to notice other, bigger, things. Things that you thought were a trick of the eye. The moon looked smaller. Measurements were taken, experts consulted. A space shuttle was pulled out of retirement and sent up to confirm: the moon was moving away from us.</p>
<p>We became obsessed with measuring things, checking for changes. What else was happening? We found that the Earth&#8217;s spin was slowing. Days had become longer since The Event. Years had become longer. The wobble, Earth&#8217;s tilt on its axis, had increased. Things that should be taking millions of years were happening in months, and the rate of decay was increasing exponentially. &#8220;Everything is going to shit,&#8221; I think was the official line from the President&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>No-one knows quite what will happen in the next few weeks. The messed up days and tides have broken the food chain. Fresh food is scarce. Even the tinned goods are spilling out of their rusty containers. Maybe we won&#8217;t live to see what happens when the moon finally breaks free of its orbit. Maybe we&#8217;ll be hallucinating from hunger when the Earth stops spinning. Maybe our bones will be crumbling when the Earth tilts all the way over.</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;ll be another green flash in the sky and it will all be over.</p>
