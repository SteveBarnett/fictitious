				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve managed to fashion a crude quill using a feather from one of the beasts. Its mane is spread and spiky, and its call sends chills down my spine. But when it sleeps, it sleeps deep. I broke its neck quickly, silently, and pulled it back to my cave before I was spotted. The meat did not agree with me.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>3rd June</strong></p>
<p>Sectors 1, 2, and 4 report nothing unusual.<br />
Sector 3 reports loss of another peacock. Three replacements ordered: two peacocks and one gameskeeper. Usual severance package supplied.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>Day 12</strong></p>
<p>I try to sleep when the burning ball comes out, but it&#8217;s becoming dangerous. The monkeys prowl around, poking at things. Poking at my things.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like the way they move. All jittery and stuttery. I will take one down before the end of this cycle. I will kill it and post it as a warning for the others.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>June 15th</strong></p>
<p>Sectors 1, 2, and 4 report nothing unusual.<br />
Sector 3 reports loss of more wildlife. Fire broke out on Tuesday, contained by rapid response.<br />
Oh, and three rangers found dead, skinned, and hung from trees.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>Day 24</strong></p>
<p>Too many. I ate too many. Mushrooms and meat and leaves and flowers that sting. I seem to be leaking, and I can&#8217;t make it stop.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>July 7th</strong></p>
<p>Sectors 1 and 4 report nothing unusual.<br />
Sector 2 reports minor damage to some enclosures.<br />
Sector 3 reports discovery of hollowed out tree. Dead body inside. Trunk covered with indecipherable scribble. Three tubs of prescription medication, unopened.<br />
Construction has begun on Sector 5.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The small knuckle bone in this display case seems an unlikely candidate; but many have described it as the most significant scientific find of all time.<br />
The bone came out of a dig near Tehran in the late 80&#8242;s but sat in a cupboard in Harvard&#8217;s anthropology department for three decades before its  significance was understood.   Jeffery Muffin,  a graduate student who was doing a detailed analysis of the fossilized stomach contents of early hominids,  was the first to examine the bone under a microscope and discovered its extraordinary internal structure.<br />
The bone is thought to be the last segment of a finely-jointed probing appendage. Ventral striations near the end of the bone indicate the bone was traumatically severed,  most probably bitten off, just above the first joint.<br />
The bone remains the only conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life; who they were and what they were doing we may never know.  But we do know that they visited our world and walked among our hominid ancestors; and that all they left behind was a severed fingertip.</p>
