				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time they&#8217;ll let me in. This time I&#8217;ll cut the mustard.<br />
I stride confidently up to the huge, heavy, wooden doors and thrust my hand out at the doorman.<br />
&#8220;Jackson,&#8221; I say, smiling, but not beaming. &#8220;Ralph Jackson. I&#8217;m here for the event.&#8221;<br />
The doorman looks at my hand like it&#8217;s something he&#8217;s scraped off his shoe.<br />
&#8220;Yes. Well.&#8221; He taps at his data pad and flicks up and down the list. &#8220;I&#8217;m… sorry, Mr Jackson, but you don&#8217;t appear to be on the list.&#8221;<br />
I give him my best scowl and stride off before he can strip any more of my dignity from me. Maybe I can try the back door.<br />
I try and stroll casually around the back of the building. I catch a whiff of garlic: kitchens must be this way. I find a door that&#8217;s ajar and creep up to it. I swing it open, and the doorman is standing there, waiting for me.<br />
&#8220;Can I help you, sir?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;How did you…? Never mind.&#8221;  I run off around the corner, cursing under my breath. &#8220;Dammit!&#8221; I punch the wall. Hmm, soft.<br />
Vines run up from the ground to the top of the building. I give them a firm pull: they seem pretty sturdy. I scramble my way up to the first floor. No doorman.<br />
The curtains are drawn.<br />
The door is unlocked, and opens smoothly.<br />
I pull back the curtains and discover the secret they&#8217;ve been hiding from me for all these months. I scream and scream until I go hoarse and my eyes water. Then I turn and run and dive off the balcony.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are cordially invited, by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, to our Annual dinner celebrating Strength in Leadership. A select group of world leaders will gather together at our lush alpine head quarters to enjoy fine food and the company of rarefied peers.<br />
Our CEO, Johan Musieth, accompanied by twenty exotic women of great beauty, will present a short audio visual programme on the new legislation coming out of the Brussels entitled: Asset Seizure and Crimes Against Humanity &#8211; How to keep what is rightfully yours.<br />
After dinner we will announce the winner of the Batista Award for ‘Excellence in Protection of National Financial Assets’ and present a life-time membership award to President Mugabe for his ongoing loyalty to the institutions of international banking.<br />
So grab this chance to relax in the company of others who understand the difficulties of power, who suffer the same misrepresentation in the international press and have a chance to sample those gourmet delights so difficult to acquire in your home territories in this modern political climate.</p>
