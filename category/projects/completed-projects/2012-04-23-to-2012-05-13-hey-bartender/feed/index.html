<ul>
<li>1 shot Kahlua</li>
<li>1 shot vodka</li>
<li>1 shot Jägermeister</li>
<li>1 pint Pilsner</li>
</ul>
<p>Fill a glass with ice. Pour over the Kahlua and vodka.<br />
Down in one smooth motion. Chase with the Jägermeister, poured into the Pilsner.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had anyone ask me for one of these in years. Who told you about it? He still alive? Shit, have this one on the house. Tell him I said hi.<br />
You know he invented this, right? He was sitting right where you are, about ten years ago. He was about six Black Russians to the wind and he couldn&#8217;t decide if he wanted to go home or go on. He ordered a shot of Kahlua, a shot of vodka, a shot of Jäger, a glass, and a pint of Pilsner. He stared at the drinks for a minute, then poured the Kahlua and vodka into the glass, downed it, poured the Jäger into the Pilsner, then downed that. Once I managed to wake him up, I called him a cab and sent him home. He was back the next night and ordered the same again: a Black Bavarian.</p>

<p>So if they come in here after work and somehow never leave before that dreaded early start we usually give them this one on the house. Call it a nod to public safety.</p>

<p>So we were backpacking around the world when we were in our 20s, like people do. We were sitting in some dive bar in Santiago and a guy comes up to us, halfway through a bottle of pisco, and tells us he can give us a great exchange rate for our dollars. While we&#8217;re trying to explain that we&#8217;re not American, he puts the finishing touches to our cocktails-in-progress with the remains of his bottle. The bartender hustles him out, assuring us he&#8217;s harmless.</p>
<p>The name of the drink? You&#8217;ve seen those Easter Island Maoi heads, right? That&#8217;s how yours feels the next day.</p>

<p>They say this one came from East LA, where the muso&#8217;s used to hang. It was created by the legendary Harry Hunter at the Velvet club one night for Jim Morrison. Although it did little for his whiny voice it became a favourite among rock musicians needing a bit of vocal assistance before a show: sweet enough to solve the munchies, smooth enough to make you feel like James Brown and rough enough to make you sound like Joe Cocker.</p>
