				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I take a last drag on my cigarette, then stub it out on the crumbling brick wall. A working guy across the street gives me a  dirty look. Even in this crappy part of town smoking is frowned upon. At least here it&#8217;s not illegal like it is uptown. Can&#8217;t have people smoking outside banks and schools, apparently.</p>
<p>I shrug my knapsack up higher on my shoulder, start walking from shadow to shadow towards my destination. Don&#8217;t want to attract any unwanted attention. Especially not when I&#8217;m carrying this much.</p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s the night. A game this big is usually too high stakes for me. But a friend got me in the door, as long as I could put up the currency. So I scraped it together.</p>
<p>I knock on the door. A peep hole slides open. I get a look, a squint, then a nod. The hole slides shut, and the door slides open. She thumbs at the corridor, points with her eyes. I take a few strides down and there&#8217;s another door. The floor&#8217;s kinda slimy.</p>
<p>I look back down the corridor at the bouncer. I point at the door, raise my eyebrows. She nods. I open the door.</p>
<p>The three others are already here, sitting around the poker table. They look at me like I don&#8217;t belong here. I don&#8217;t. I know it. But I&#8217;m not going to let that stop me. I pull my knapsack off my shoulder, put it down on the table. I reach in, pull out the currency, slam it down on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three squid.&#8221; They start squirming. &#8220;Now how about we play some poker?&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome all, those physically corporate and those outside the dimensionality, to the prize giving of the Junior Emergent Complexity Challenge: The only contest where teams of young minds from every culture get to have some hands-on fun with the very substance of life.</p>
<p>Once again this year the teams have surprised us with innovative new tweaks to the base materials with some truly surprising results. Each team starting with the same slime evolved something unique and interesting and all are worthy of praise; but as we all know not everybody can win so lets me put you all out of your agony and get on with it.</p>
<p>But first a special mention … Team Zeph-Eta-X with their entry ‘Sol and Earth’. This marvellous system shows all the reckless creativity and innovation that our contest is famous for. The world of these young creators bred more complexity, much faster than any other in the contest. They started with a high energy carbon system loaded with iron and it paid out in all its multi-coloured glory. The judges wish to particularly commend the ‘ant’ colony network that enmeshes the surface in a biological hive-mind and the minimal beauty of the monoculture kelp forests of the subsurface coastal plains.</p>
<p>However the judges felt that as the system had not achieved bio-stability (and with the system’s intrinsically high burn ratio) these wonders were unfortunately ephemeral phenomenon and as such could not be considered in the judging.</p>
<p>And now, on to the winners&#8230;the first runner up is&#8230;</p>
