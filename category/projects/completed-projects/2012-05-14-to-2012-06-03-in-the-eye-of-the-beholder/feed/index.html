				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;And… Action!&#8221;</p>
<p>This will be the one. The one that gets me the nomination. The ones that gets me the award.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fed up being mocked by… by everyone. Producers. Execs. Other directors. Even the goddam actors. I am a good director. I am *excellent* director. Remember the tapes: &#8220;You are empowered to be the center of your own excellence.&#8221; I am empowered to be the center of my own excellence. I am… shit, I am *something*, and it is great.</p>
<p>This will be the one. The perfect episode. Comedy. Tradegy. I&#8217;ll have the audience in tears of laughter one minute and tears of sorrow the next. The ratings will shoot through the roof.</p>
<p>And… glass smash! Fantastic. Great wrist work. The right amount of stiff, the right amount of limp. And… cue tear. Damn, he&#8217;s good. Look at that redness around the eye. Fantastic.</p>
<p>“And… Cut! This is gonna be the best damn episode of The Young and The Beautiful ever made. Great work boys!”</p>

I don&#8217;t really know that guy Harry, we did a few classes together last year at the tech, but I wouldn&#8217;t call him a friend. He&#8217;s just an acquantance who happens to live opposite my bus stop, I don&#8217;t really know much about him, and last Tuesday he was acting crazy.</p>
<p>He had this chick he&#8217;d been spading for weeks, ummm, sorry ma&#8217;am, this woman that he had been keen on had finally come up to his room but he didn&#8217;t have a condom. It was embarrassing! There was this mean looking old man watching from across the street and all these teenagers and this Harry guy keeps going on about this girl. I tried to quiet him down but he was frantic &#8211; I gave him a condom from my wallet eventually just to shut him up.</p>
<p>That Romeo was too cheap to buy his own box and he wasn&#8217;t subtle about taking it either &#8211; I had to tell the kids it was an imported sweetie; I couldn&#8217;t tell them the truth, they&#8217;re pretty naive about sex; especially that little Warren kid.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jesus, I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m still doing this after five years. I should have stayed on the stage. Or gone into porn like my agent was suggesting.<br />
“Oh, hi, Honey.”<br />
Eat olive, Smile.<br />
I wonder if my smile still looks good.<br />
“Just out. Relax, sweetie. I was thinking of you the whole time.”<br />
Drink.<br />
Oh, this day would have gone so much better if this was actually a martini and not just water. Evian, yes, but still. A shaken not stirred would be better.<br />
“I’m fixing myself another. Want one?”<br />
Jeffrey&#8217;s character hits glass, shatters, cries.<br />
This is the *third* take for this ridiculous scene. It takes them ten minutes just to hoover up all the sugar glass. Christ, Peter, just move on. It&#8217;s not Shakespeare.<br />
Turn around. Hunch. Tense.<br />
“What if I was? At least he’s there for me when I need him.”<br />
And… Scene. At last. Now for that drink. And wardrobe. And makeup.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I suppose officer, there was a guy with faded jeans here Tuesday, we often see him, he takes the number 62, same as Johnny and Ted and Mike and me and that other kid Warren on Tuesdays and Fridays &#8211; we  see him most days after school. And there was another guy here Tuesday, came down from those flats across the way  &#8211; he was a weird guy; never seen a dude so desperate for chewing gum &#8211; it was real pathetic.</p>
<p>This other guy, he was like excited, but he wouldn&#8217;t just come out and say that he needed chewing gum, instead he says all this stuff about this girl who at his apartment and he really needed it right now &#8211; I dunno, you know all that crap that the varsity guys talk. Anyway the jeans guy starts on about how much it costs and eventually agrees to sell for like R10 &#8211; ja I know man, a lot for a single stick of gum but this guy doesn&#8217;t care he just passes the cash over and runs off back to his girl.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t normal gum, that&#8217;s what the jeans guy told me when I asked him after that other guy left &#8211; he wouldn&#8217;t let me see the pack either &#8211; like he was ashamed of it &#8211; but he told us it was special imported gum.</p>

There was Rod, reclining on the couch, sipping a martini. &#8220;Oh, hi, Honey,&#8221; he said, popping the olive into his mouth. &#8220;Goddammit, Rod! I was worried sick. Where were you? It&#8217;s been days!&#8221; Rod flashed his bright white smile at him. &#8220;Just out. Relax, sweetie. I was thinking of you the whole time,&#8221; he said. He downed the drink. &#8220;I&#8217;m fixing myself another,&#8221; he said, waggling the glass. &#8220;Want one?&#8221; Lance &#8230; <a href="/2012/05/20/set-1/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

&#8220;Goddammit, Rod! I was worried sick. Where were you? It&#8217;s been days!&#8221;<br />
Rod flashed his bright white smile at him.<br />
&#8220;Just out. Relax, sweetie. I was thinking of you the whole time,&#8221; he said. He downed the drink. &#8220;I&#8217;m fixing myself another,&#8221; he said, waggling the glass. &#8220;Want one?&#8221;<br />
Lance smacked it out his hand, sending it into the oak dresser and shattering it into a thousand pieces. A single tear rolled down his cheek and dripped on to his shirt, forming a small, heart-shaped dark patch.<br />
&#8220;You were with him, weren&#8217;t you? With Dick.&#8221;<br />
Rod turned his back on Lance, hunching his shoulders, and tensing his arms.<br />
&#8220;What if I was? At least he&#8217;s there for me when I need him.&#8221;<br />
Lance wiped his eye and sniffed.<br />
&#8220;Then maybe he should just have you. Maybe I don&#8217;t love you anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p>&#8220;And&#8230; Cut! This is gonna be the best damn episode of The Young and The Beautiful ever made. Great work boys!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was standing on the other side of the street waiting, at my age you have to stay away from those hooligan school kids at the bus stop. There were six of them hanging around the bus stop smoking hand-rolled cigarettes; at least I assume they were cigarettes. Five of them looked rough  but quite young, perhaps fourteen. They were clowning about while the ringleader, a older kid in stone washed denim, looked for business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I saw the deal go down. A twenty-something with greasy hair and a black leather jacket came down from that block of flats across there. He looked very anxious and impatient, obviously overwrought. He spoke to the ring leader for a moment; it seemed they had a disagreement about the price. Then I saw him hand some cash over and the dealer slips him something in an obviously subversive manner. You could just see they were hiding something. The awful cheek of this generation , they have no respect for the law.</p>
