				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally ready,<br />
She takes her hands off her eyes,<br />
And stands up, stand tall.</p>
<p>Her black silk shirt is weightless;<br />
the floor, cold beneath bare feet</p>
<p>the stone is worn smooth and sleek,<br />
but splinters stick to her sole</p>
<p>She walks with full confidence,<br />
Hiding the consuming fear.</p>
<p>By the oak tree stump<br />
An axe is being sharpened</p>
<p>Made for her light build,<br />
Designed to be swung just once.</p>
<p>The sacrifice sits<br />
Bound, gagged, blindfolded, waiting.<br />
It stirs, tries to speak.</p>
<p>Horror consumes her<br />
as she sees the victim&#8217;s face.<br />
Inhuman. Strange. Wrong.</p>
<p>Features swim around its face,<br />
Shimmer like sun on water<br />
She must to kill it.</p>
<p>Something deep within call out:<br />
Erase this wrongness.</p>
<p>Fingers wrap around the axe.<br />
She swings it, testing its weight.<br />
She feels it in her:</p>
<p>The human urge to murder,<br />
To kill the unknown.</p>
<p>She takes short, quick, steps forward.<br />
She raises the axe up high.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In freezing water<br />
he swims lethargically,<br />
hoping to see light.</p>
<p>His fingertips start to numb,<br />
the cold closing in on him.</p>
<p>It struck his left wrist.<br />
Entanglement from the dark.<br />
Then a sudden tug.</p>
<p>Adrenaline starts pumping,<br />
Not like this. No, not like this.</p>
<p>Dragged downward, enclosed.<br />
Air to breathe and giant eyes<br />
he gasps at the warmth.</p>
<p>His sore eyes adjust slowly<br />
He can&#8217;t believe what he sees</p>
<p>This black humid space,<br />
lit by the great golden eyes,<br />
feels like sanctuary.<br />
It feels just like coming home.<br />
He smiles in spite of himself.</p>
<p>No longer afraid,<br />
he opened himself to it.<br />
Ego-less comfort.</p>
<p>Large soft hands grip his shoulders,<br />
Hold him firmly, but not still.</p>
<p>So much was revealed,<br />
But he never spoke of it.<br />
Some truths are secret.</p>
<p>He still remembers the smell.<br />
Like rain running on tarmac.</p>
<p>Weeks later he returned,<br />
Washed up on a remote beach.<br />
Unconscious, smiling.</p>
