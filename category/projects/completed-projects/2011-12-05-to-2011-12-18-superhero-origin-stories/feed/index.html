<p>“Superpowers” they called it. Like everyone was suddenly flying or had x-ray vision. But it wasn’t like that: it was mostly small, strange things.</p>
<p>My buddy Mike gained an incredible sense of smell. Could tell you where you’d been days ago. But the power only worked one day a week. My old lady’s left arm became fireproof. Just the arm, just the left.<br />
I was sitting waiting in Grand Central one day. She was late, as usual. I looked down at my watch, then up at the station clock: 11.24. I’d been there almost an hour. I stared down at my watch again, sighed. My eyes widened as I followed the hands of my watch slow down, then wind backwards, then stop at 11.05. I looked back up at the station clock: 11.24.</p>
<p>&sect;</p>
<p>In the morning I tried again. My watch was on the breakfast counter. I concentrated on it, hard, and saw it slow. A fly took off from a dirty plate in the sink and flew across my face. As it crossed over my watch it slowed down, then stopped: it suspended in the air. I concentrated harder, and the hands started turning back. The fly moved backwards along its flight path. About ten centimetres out it suddenly burst from the bubble, sped up, shot away on another trajectory.</p>
<p>&sect;</p>
<p>Before I knew it I’d jumped back to the day we all got our powers. Then three days before. Then a fortnight. Then a year. Then more. Then I knew I’d lost control of it.<br />
And now I’m scratching this into a cave wall with an arrow head. And then I feel the familiar tingle, and I know I’m about to go again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know me. I’m that <em>[kid/girl/chap/dude/freak/recruit]</em>, in the <em>[back row/audit team/laundromat/other platoon/cafeteria]</em>, whose name you nearly remember, who you once <em>[shared a bus seat with/got coffee for/borrowed a quarter from/bought dope from/had a one night stand with]</em>. I was on that<em> [school trip we took/last minute project/reconnaissance mission/cleaning detail/expedition/road trip to Vegas]</em>, remember? <em>[The science lab. / That mountain cave. / The night of the freak storm. / That mysterious enemy base. / That members-only club.]</em></p>
<p>I got to the <em>[bus/taxi/shuttle/helicopter/party/briefing]</em>  late, ended up <em>[next to that fat kid/taking the minutes/doing the clean-up/standing all the way/running/fired]</em>. The <em>[lab/club/client site/forest/tunnel/casino/road]</em> was <em>[cold/messy/loud/humid/dark/wet]</em>.  You were all <em>[having fun/getting on with it/following orders/taking stock/organised]</em>. I hung back. I didn’t want <em>[any trouble/to be killed/extra work/you to notice me/anymore to drink]</em>.</p>
<p>It’s strange how <em>[Mr White’s/the client’s/Roger’s/all the girls’/the presenter’s]</em> attention was elsewhere that moment, how all the <em>[scientists/secretaries/team leaders/reporters/soldiers]</em> got <em>[important calls/sand in their eyes/the urge for a cigarette]</em> at just that second. How you all turned away, all at once, at that one crucial moment when I <em>[stumbled and fell into that vat/was bitten by that spider/got shot by that strange dart/looked up into those dark spots on the sun/read the forbidden words/snorted what looked like perfectly good coke]</em>.</p>
<p>How unavoidable it seems in hindsight. I remember the pain, the heat; I remember your screams.</p>
<p>I remember becoming.</p>
<p>In the infinite universes, in a myriad untold ways&#8230; Quantum <em>[Man/Woman]</em> happens.</p>
<p>Every time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Thi’si retreat high in the mountains of Nepal the warrior monks began the final cycle of the chant they had begun 200 years before.  This prayer was given to call the spirit of the great warrior Seiyan, an arhat whose enlightenment had led him beyond the strictures of space and time. On the altar kneels the Assiri: a beautiful, golden youth with dark hair and fierce eyes. Since his careful selection in childhood the best teachers have dedicated their lives to moulding him into the perfect vessel. When the cycle completes a perfect silence falls over the monastery. They gaze expectantly at the Assiri.</p>
<p>Liefe Wessels is sitting on her uncomfortable couch in Kuilsriver. She has never been wealthy and long years of hardship show in her lined face. This year her third child will leave home and for a moment she cheerfully contemplates her autumn years of soap operas and church fetes.</p>
<p>As the enlightenment of Seiyan descends upon her she sighs deeply – time to have a little talk with that violent drunk, Mr Johnson, at number 22 and then on to the central African problem. But before all the work begins she thinks to indulge a childhood fantasy. As she looks about at ancient Gaza, 2500BCE, she smiles: she had always dreamed of seeing the pyramids.</p>
