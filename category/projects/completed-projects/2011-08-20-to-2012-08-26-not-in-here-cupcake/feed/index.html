<p>&#8220;Nice work, pardner,&#8221; she nodded nonchalantly at him. &#8220;Uh oh.&#8221; She pointed at the undead interloper with her grimy golf club. &#8220;See the shakin&#8217;? We gots ourselves an asploder.&#8221; She rushed up and rolled the body over their flung-together fence and collapsed them both onto their cabooses just in time to hear it snack, crackle, and pop into a hundred pestilent pieces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shee-it! When did they start doing that?&#8221; he said, brushing bone and blood off his jeans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just afore you got arrived. You ain&#8217;t see &#8216;em blow up before? Are you new here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stereo speakers up in the corner of the room fizzled and futzed: &#8220;Level 3.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>So what’s the problem Mr B-Man!</em></p>
<p>Please call me Butcher, Boss, as your father did. I got your email about the Irish situation, the kid downstairs printed it out for me. I just don’t think I can do this, you know the baked goods and all.</p>
<p><em>But B, it’s a brilliant idea &#8211; creepy like the Joker from Batman you know &#8211; craaazy and scary. Send your nemesis something you knows he likes, cupcakes, iced with a threatening note &#8211; it’s fucking brilliant.</em></p>
<p>I don’t think the Irishman’s gonna get it Sir. You know his niece is living down on the south coast &#8211; we know some boys down there &#8211; we could leave a bloody-clear message like your dad did in ‘86.</p>
<p><em>We’re not gang-bangers Mr B; show some class. My dad said when it comes to intimidation you were the man. “The only guy who can get a severed horse’s head on short notice in New York city” &#8211; he often said that. Now are you still that man or not?</em></p>
<p>Yes Boss; for the family; if it is the new way; I’ll find us a friendly baker.</p>
