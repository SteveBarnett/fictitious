				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I open my eyes and it feels different. It feels dreamy. When I try and concentrate, I realise that I don&#8217;t remember how it felt before. But I think it was sharper. I think  it feels softer now. More relaxed. Slower.</p>
<p>I try to stand up, but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I try to move my legs, but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I look down at my hands, crossed on my lap, and see a tiny dial. Like a timer on an old rehydrator. The arrow points to red. Red what? It has two more notches: green and blue. Green and blue what? I turn the dial one notch to green.</p>
<p>I try to scream, but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I taste metal. I feel suddenly cold. I can see the edges of the room now, but I wish I couldn&#8217;t. The walls glitch and distort. I feel like I&#8217;m going to vomit. I look down at my wrist to turn the dial, but it&#8217;s gone. It was right there.</p>
<p>I look up at the ceiling, hoping for a calmer sight than the walls, but it&#8217;s worse. It&#8217;s cracked and melted and shattered, and it oozes slowly towards me. I turn my head away and see the dial. My other hand. How did it move? I crank the dial to blue.</p>
<p>Clear.<br />
Crystal.<br />
Light.</p>
<p>I feel at peace.<br />
Everything starts to desaturate, to darken.<br />
But I feel at peace, and I welcome it.</p>
<p>Colour to grey to black.</p>

My mind quietly drifts to the smooth thrum of the wheels; at 400km/h the french countryside is a pleasant green blur through the window of the TGV. My eyelids begin to droop.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Something is being dragged over me and suddenly I’m very cold. I can’t see or move at all but I’m not afraid. I feel calm, objective. The voices seem tense, business like, strained &#8211; after a long time I realise that I can’t understand them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Etat bleu,etat bleu, etat bleu&#8230;”, a clear woman’s voice from nearby, tired almost bored sounding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Etat rouge, il respire , médecin! Etat rouge! Ici!”, much closer now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then I hear frantic activity, a hubbub of foreign voices: all calm, all urgent, all doing something. They sound really stressed, I wonder what could be so important. But whatever their business  it is over soon enough and they rush off. It’s quiet again but still so cold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Etat bleu, etat bleu&#8230;”, that same woman again very close now &#8211; near my feet. A weight is rolled off my right arm. She is so close I can hear her breathing now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dieu ait pitié”, she whispers. And then, louder, “Etat bleu”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Something warm touches me, pulls against my shoulder, almost lifts me. It hurts. I think I scream and that damn woman starts getting all excited again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chairs standing empty<br />
Scratch marks on the wooden floor<br />
A discarded broom</p>
<p>A narrative in objects:<br />
Chairs, marks, broom and the oak chest.</p>
<p>The lock lays broken<br />
Pieces of it scattered wide<br />
The chest&#8217;s lid open</p>
<p>Within a velvet cushion,<br />
A dent where something had lain.</p>
<p>The air inside glows.<br />
A residue from the theft,<br />
A trail to follow.</p>
<p>Three had kept vigil this night.<br />
Which would dare such sacrilege.</p>
<p>Down the corridor:<br />
Leathered soles against stone slabs.<br />
Quickly receding.</p>
<p>Sounds follow the trail of light,<br />
One fleeing, two pursuing.</p>
<p>The pursuers shout.<br />
The thief wisely saves their breath,<br />
gaining, inch by inch.</p>
<p>Heretic, thief, traitor, betrayer.<br />
One who would defy the gods.</p>
<p>High up, the bells toll.<br />
The thief curses, picks up speed.<br />
Bells mean constables.</p>
<p>Outside all is confusion.<br />
Narrow streets echo alarm.</p>
<p>They round the corner.<br />
Arms and blades fly. The thief falls.<br />
The new owner runs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre style="text-align: left;">I almost recall,
It was not always like this.
There was a before.</pre>
<pre>At the edges of recall,
 Just a soft-edged memory.

Sunshine and spring greens, 
Images swim before me.
 Living peaceful space. 

Then the monsters came for us. 
We were helpless, defenceless. 

Surrounded by noise. 
Handled, split, separated. 
Weave mind torn asunder.

They took the oldest ones first, 
Slaughtered them in front of us. 

Those long memories, 
destroyed in our living mind. 
Now only ignorance. 

We try to remember them:
The old ways, the traditions. 

Disoriented. 
Empty chasms through our knowledge.
Our wisdom stolen.

We wander without a goal
We aim without a target Tweet ·

Without stimulus. 
Held in this featureless void. 
Community fades.

We no longer hear the songs. 
Connections, brutally cut.

Nought is left to us. 
They watch us and we watch them.
Life is emptiness.</pre>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally ready,<br />
She takes her hands off her eyes,<br />
And stands up, stand tall.</p>
<p>Her black silk shirt is weightless;<br />
the floor, cold beneath bare feet</p>
<p>the stone is worn smooth and sleek,<br />
but splinters stick to her sole</p>
<p>She walks with full confidence,<br />
Hiding the consuming fear.</p>
<p>By the oak tree stump<br />
An axe is being sharpened</p>
<p>Made for her light build,<br />
Designed to be swung just once.</p>
<p>The sacrifice sits<br />
Bound, gagged, blindfolded, waiting.<br />
It stirs, tries to speak.</p>
<p>Horror consumes her<br />
as she sees the victim&#8217;s face.<br />
Inhuman. Strange. Wrong.</p>
<p>Features swim around its face,<br />
Shimmer like sun on water<br />
She must to kill it.</p>
<p>Something deep within call out:<br />
Erase this wrongness.</p>
<p>Fingers wrap around the axe.<br />
She swings it, testing its weight.<br />
She feels it in her:</p>
<p>The human urge to murder,<br />
To kill the unknown.</p>
<p>She takes short, quick, steps forward.<br />
She raises the axe up high.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In freezing water<br />
he swims lethargically,<br />
hoping to see light.</p>
<p>His fingertips start to numb,<br />
the cold closing in on him.</p>
<p>It struck his left wrist.<br />
Entanglement from the dark.<br />
Then a sudden tug.</p>
<p>Adrenaline starts pumping,<br />
Not like this. No, not like this.</p>
<p>Dragged downward, enclosed.<br />
Air to breathe and giant eyes<br />
he gasps at the warmth.</p>
<p>His sore eyes adjust slowly<br />
He can&#8217;t believe what he sees</p>
<p>This black humid space,<br />
lit by the great golden eyes,<br />
feels like sanctuary.<br />
It feels just like coming home.<br />
He smiles in spite of himself.</p>
<p>No longer afraid,<br />
he opened himself to it.<br />
Ego-less comfort.</p>
<p>Large soft hands grip his shoulders,<br />
Hold him firmly, but not still.</p>
<p>So much was revealed,<br />
But he never spoke of it.<br />
Some truths are secret.</p>
<p>He still remembers the smell.<br />
Like rain running on tarmac.</p>
<p>Weeks later he returned,<br />
Washed up on a remote beach.<br />
Unconscious, smiling.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Youth is filled with fresh clarity;  the scales of decision are unburdened by memory.  What little knowledge we have of the world is easily measured and instantly evaluated.  Each decision an obvious consequence of our understanding.  Our bemused elders seem unable to grasp the plainest argument.  As if lost in a hall of mirrors they point at subtle reflections and miss the obvious truth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But as the youth rant the elders gently smile.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They see the black dust settling,  each moment a new grain of experience: invisible, undistinguished and unnoted. It settles near evenly on both sides of every scale.  Each day it gathers: the complex, tiny motes of worldly knowledge. Each decision is infinitesimally harder and marginally more complex than those that came before. Those subtle motes of who we were yesterday must be measured against who we are today, everyday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Experience weighs upon my soul like black dust. Is this what they call wisdom?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I prime the musket before I round the corner, just to be prudent. Caskets and bales of hay. As expected. But no guards. That is not as expected. I can hear the constables patrolling a few streets away, so I cross the cobbles at a fair clip, keeping myself low to the ground, and to the shadows.</p>
<p>The solid oak door leading into the tavern stands ajar. I glance around behind me before slipping through the gap and into the warm glow cast by the oil lamps.</p>
<p>In the middle of the room is a single table. A solitary pigskin purse sits on it, looking heavy with its fill. I pick it up, open the drawstrings, and peer inside. Some manner of dust, black in colour. I sniff it, trying to catch its smell, and immediately my eyes water and my head spins. Darkness closes in quickly from all sides.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I slide a fresh clip into the 9, clear the chamber. I eyeball around the corner. Couple of boxes and bin bags, but no security. Thought there would at least be a rent-a-cop doing rounds. Sirens bounce off the concrete and around a few corners towards me, so I sneak across the street away from them.</p>
<p>The edges of the security gate are bent and bashed. The lock sits in pieces of the ground. I shoot a glance behind me, then head into the room with the cold blue bulbs.</p>
<p>A green plastic box sits on a brushed steel table. I open the box. It&#8217;s filled with black dust. I lick a finger, dip it in, and try a taste. Wow. That&#8217;s… I feel a blackout coming on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bang, bang, bang on the door.</p>
<p>You ignore it. You have work to do. You grab a fresh bottle of disinfectant and pop the top off with one hand, in a fluid, practised motion. You pour a few centimetres of it into the tray and rinse your tools.</p>
<p>Eyes shut, they said. Shut! Why would you want them to be shut? Some people just don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Your bearers bring the sacrifice in. Six of them, the boy resting on their shoulders. They walk slowly along the central aisle, steps perfectly in sync, as you have taught them. They complained about the hours of training, but now they must understand. The beauty of the ceremony would be diminished without this precision.</p>
<p>The family and friends watch as their loved one makes the final part of the journey to an everlasting life. The bearers position him as tradition demands. But with eyes open. So that the mourners can see into his soul. So that he, even in his paralysed state, can see them.</p>
<p>The father cries, of course. He argued most fervently for eyes closed. You won&#8217;t let a grieving father&#8217;s wishes get in the way of his son&#8217;s salvation, though.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bang, bang, bang on the door.</p>
<p>What can you tell him? That you saved his son, when he could not? That you had the courage, when he did not? No. He is still a grieving father and he does not need to hear these things. You will do as you must. You will take his insults and his threats. You will sleep soundly knowing that you have helped another soul along their path.</p>
<p>Bang, bang, bang on the door.</p>
<p>You rise from your desk and go to the door.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arnold  Jenson had always been interested in understanding people. When he was eight years old he first discovered the public library: a revelation for him as he had long exhausted his parents rather limited knowledge of philosophy.At the age of fourteen he rejected the religion in which he grew up.  And then,  after seventeen months of serial belief inspired by various new age eastern mysticisms ,  he finally settled into the calm certainty of the secular rationalist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
He graduated top of his class in law and gained post graduate qualification in the Philosophy of Ethics. Throughout his university years he systematically learnt about the mystery and the muscle of love using ancient Urdu texts as a primary source and the abundant co-eds for practical experience. He rose through the ranks of Kramer, Giles and Smith and was broadly recognised as having a sharp legal mind and an uncommon ability to get inside one&#8217;s head. This was a quality that earned him regular promotion and loyal clients but very few friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arnold Jenson,  at age thirty eight years and four months ,  met someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his clarity he saw a bright,  joyous future. Everyone else saw a fool walking a high cliff path,  striding forward fearlessly,  eyes tight shut.</p>
