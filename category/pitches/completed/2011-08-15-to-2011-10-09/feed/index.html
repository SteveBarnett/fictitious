<p><span id="more-64"></span>A train carriage with say 20 passengers. We all post short vignettes of various characters, ideally linking some together. It would be great if character descriptions could feed off each other backwards and forwards &#8211; if a grey-haired man is peering over his newspaper at you in character 1, character 13 is the grey-haired man, and we find out what he sees. Or why. I like the idea that to start off with we would not define where the train is, where it&#8217;s going, what kind of train it is. Is this contemporary or old, or future? I&#8217;d like it to emerge through the stories.</p>
<p>To avoid contradictions, it may be best to rotate deliverables. If we make it a small group, say just 3, we could write one character a week; so each one of us only writes one character every 3 weeks. The alternative is that we agree on a setting and vague parameters for the train, and then I think we could bring in 1 character a week each &#8211; will go faster, done in 6-7 weeks. I&#8217;m not going to fill in all the parameters yet because I think they are open for discussion. 200 &#8211; 300 words per character?</p>
<p>It may make sense to make and track a seating plan as we go along too&#8230;</p>
<p>Comments &#8211; I don&#8217;t know if they would be needed, I think the gratification of commenting would come from the references other authors make to your characters &#8211; but we could have room for comments too?</p>
