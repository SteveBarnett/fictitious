				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/fictitious.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Footnotes.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-328 aligncenter" title="Footnotes" src="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/fictitious.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Footnotes-273x300.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I suggest we take this descriptive passage (from Agatha Christie) and give it more meaning and narrative by adding a series of footnotes on each of the nouns in brackets:</p>
<blockquote><p>The small [drawing-room] was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some [Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses], on the [mantelpiece], simpering sweetly. There were [framed water-colours], [two samplers], and [three needlework pictures] on the wall. There were some [photographs] of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture &#8211; a [Chippendale desk], some little [satin-wood tables] &#8211; and a hideous and rather uncomfortable [Victorian sofa].</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea is to provide 10 to 100 words for each marked noun: These chunks might be description, back story or random musing so to create an idea or narrative out of this otherwise descriptive paragraph.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll find some clever hover over way to display peoples definitions on the web.</p>
<p>Commitment details: 3 weeks , 3+ people?</p>
