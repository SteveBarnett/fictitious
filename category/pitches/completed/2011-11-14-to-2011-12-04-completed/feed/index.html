<p>You find an old lantern in a junk shop one day. You buy it, take it home, polish it up.<br />
Out pops a Genie and offers you three wishes. Your word your requests carefully, so as not to get caught out.<br />
But you do. People always do.</p>
<p>Every few thousand years, the Genie&#8217;s Guild brings together its best and brightest to share stories of Wishers and their Wishes. The best stories, the tales of the most creative and cruel interpretations of a Wish, win the Genie freedom from their lanternic prison. The rest go back to the bottle.</p>
<p>Our job, Fictious folk, is to transcribe the scrolls containing these tales.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Time</strong>: 3 weeks.<br />
<strong>Words</strong>: about 500.</p>
