				<p>It had not always been a drawing-room, though a new visitor would never notice this. Madame had ensured the transformation was complete: even the elaborate fireplace and bay window had been torn out and made unrecognisable through the skilful efforts of Mr French and his apprentices. Only the sofa, a Victorian monstrosity without charm or comfort, remained untouched, a jarring reminder of that fateful night. </p>

				<p>Tonight, she will be devoured by the devil.</p>
<p>She is unable to resist. She feels him, radiating heat, pulsating like a bulge in reality. This is why she is on this train, this is why she needs to bear the erupting teenager, the clumsy slut, the stinking drunk. To catch a devil.</p>
<p>She turns to the blind man beside her like she would to her family confessor. &#8220;Some things are fated, do you understand?&#8221; He nods, turning his sightless eyes towards her. &#8220;But there is honour in trying to resist such fate, isn&#8217;t there?&#8221; he answers. They pretend this talk is about the travelsick young man.</p>
<p>The Comtessa imagines resisting fate. She remembers a blind man&#8217;s meticulous touch, the precision of it. She pretends to have the luxury of choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you&#8221;, she whispers to the blind man. Then she stands up, feeling the weight of her family, her clan, her coven all upon her again. &#8220;Mr Mestopheles, I believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>Black eyes burn through her. A cold, perfect hand takes hers.</p>
<p>Tonight, she will be devoured by the devil.</p>

				<p>That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m going to be late.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this damn train, isn&#8217;t it, this damn so-called public transport &#8220;system&#8221;, ha! A system needs to function to deserve that name.</p>
<p>Enough. I close my eyes and pretend to sleep, but actually I&#8217;m doing my breathing mantra and regulating my heart rate. I&#8217;m getting pretty good at it, I think.</p>
<p>What the heck is going on there, now? I just bloody hope no-one pulls the emergency brake, I would totally lapse my anger management principles on their ass. Oh God, cops? Can this day get any more unbalanced? If I had an aura (I&#8217;m still undecided about that) it would be turning black right now.</p>
<p>Ouch! What the &#8211; is someone shooting or something? That was sore, not like bullet sore, like a kick in the chest sore. What the hell?</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s stopped. A kind woman I had not noticed before comes up to me. &#8220;You look much better now&#8221;, she says, and I do feel better, better than ever. I take her hand.</p>
<p>Behind me, my lifeless head slowly tilts to rest on an unsuspecting shoulder. I look peaceful.</p>
<p>I nearly don&#8217;t recognise myself.</p>

				<p>Trucker sat next to Victoria once. None of us believed it, but he&#8217;s got a pic and all. Said David was away, she was feeling lonely, riding the train, to find someone to talk to, like.</p>
<p>So Trucker says. The pic looks real, anyways.</p>
<p>But me, I never gets to sit to no-one famous. You&#8217;d think all of them TV stars is too important for the miracle of public transport, or something. Probably have their own train, like. Or, you know, a limo.</p>

What am I gonna tell my mates: &#8220;That&#8217;s Neville Noon that is, he&#8217;s like brilliant, he&#8217;s the next Stephen King?&#8221; Man, those guys like struggle to make out the punchline on Andy Capp. Crap.</p>
<p>Oh, what the fuck: &#8220;Look, mate, sorry to bother, but are you like maybe &#8211; &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s me, love&#8221;, interrupts this sunburnt geezer, jumping up, doing like air guitar or something. Fucking up my whole approach.</p>

				<p>“Hello, my name is Winnifred.”<br />
The train rocks forward, backward. Soothing.<br />
“Winnifred Jenkins.“<br />
There’s a bit of a commotion, now.<br />
“People call me Winnie.”<br />
Why is everyone shouting?<br />
“I’ve always wanted to work for Arcadia Inc.”<br />
There is definitely some sort of situation now. With Kung Fu. Or something.<br />
“I’m sorry I’m late. Some trouble on the train.”<br />
Is that a dagger? Why are those symbols glowing?<br />
“No, nothing serious, not really&#8230;”<br />
Blood. Blood everywhere.<br />
“Excuse the stains. Like I said, a little trouble&#8230;”<br />
Does no one hear her speak the killing words?<br />
“No, of course I don’t need to see a doctor.”<br />
Does no one see the man in grey, the man with the dead eyes?<br />
“Most of the blood isn’t even mine&#8230;”<br />
He reaches into the black torrent of her curse, he reaches into her black heart.<br />
“I would have rather died than missed this opportunity&#8230;”<br />
He turns her inside out, he folds her up. She’s gone.<br />
“It was nothing, really.”<br />
His icy hand reaches inside me, inside everyone.<br />
“I guess I keep cool in a crisis.”<br />
I give him my memory. I give it willingly.<br />
“I&#8217;ve already forgotten all about it. Let&#8217;s talk about the job, shall we?&#8221;</p>

<p>It’s delicious: I rub his shoulder with mine, accidentally like. I bend over to pick up my handbag, give him a good view, heck, let my tit actually touch his knee. He’s ready to explode, all red in the face. I’m unstoppable.</p>
<p>I love flirting on trains. The caught glance, the fake innocence. We sit motionless, all proper, but underneath there is this electric current of sex appeal. And it’s subtle: a glance here, a strand of hair brushed away here. An occasional cleavage glimpse, sure, I like to play the game harder than most.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://174.120.62.98/~naga/fictitious.co.za/2011/08/27/mr-grey/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://174.120.62.98']);">guy across the carriage</a> wants to play too. The way he’s not-looking at me. He stares, fixed-like, at the commotion down the carriage, cops and whatnot, and then his head will just sort of casually swivel and he’s taking me in. I’m playing, I’m in. I can take two at a time. Last September  I eye-fucked like an entire Italian football team. I can play.</p>
<p>I lift up my arms, stretch, let my hand stroke boy-next-to-me’s hair. So soft. He turns, looks at me. That’s it, baby, I think.</p>
<p>And then he explodes.</p>

<p>The cops lower their guns. The tape speeds up. I’m back.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for that self defence class. That self defence &#8230; when on earth did I take a self defence class?</p>

&#8220;That was one hysterical broad, lad. Those tips have a way of not panning out.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;If you say so, Sarge.&#8221; You know what you are, Sarge. A Little City Policeman, sitting in his row. Like she said, now I think about it. Ten years on the force and you&#8217;re nowhere, &#8216;sarge&#8217;, and you know why? Because you&#8217;re one lazy bastard. One lazy, witless -<br />

&#8220;Yes. Sarge. Sure thing.&#8221; Sure thing, Sarge, let&#8217;s ignore the tip off about a mad bomber on this train, let&#8217;s just leave all these people to die horribly, Sarge. We&#8217;ll have saved them from the drunk though, right, Sarge? Might get a commendation for that, oh yes.<br />
&#8220;Crazy tip, anyway. Singing that nonsense Beatles tune. Lady may have had a drink or two herself, Collie, hey? Collie? What on earth are you staring at over there? Collie?&#8221;<br />

				<p>Court recording #32YYT1.B</p>
<p>In attendance: Honourable Judge Augustus Dreyer (AD); The Defendant, Mr Milo Miernik (MM); His Counsel, Advocate Howard Hetter (HH); and State Prosecutor, Genevra Rays (GR).</p>
<p>AD: “And how does the defendant plead?”</p>
<p>HH: “Your Honour, my client, Mr Miernik, pleads innocent. The damage was clearly self-inflicted.”</p>
<p>AD: “A suicide. Indeed. Well, have a seat, everyone. Prosecution, the floor is yours.”</p>
<p>GR: “Prosecution enters Exhibit A.”</p>
<p>AD: “Thank you, Ms Rays. Let the record show that Exhibit A is a blackened lump of uncertain composition, approximately 15cm in diameter. Ms Rays?”</p>
<p>GR: “Your Honour, evidence is going to be very thin on the ground given the nature of the crime. Exhibit A represents the largest remnant of the victim we have been able to find. May I now question the Defendant?”</p>
<p>AD: “Please, go ahead.”</p>
<p>GR: “Mr Miernik, where were you on the evening of March 8<sup>th</sup>?”</p>
<p>MM: “I was in Orchard Grove, Chicago. Visiting Al Robinson at his home.”</p>
<p>GR: “What was the reason for your visit?”</p>
<p>MM: “I was introducing myself to my new neighbour. I had just moved into the area.”</p>
<p>GR: “What transpired during your visit?”</p>
<p>MM: “Robinson was in real estate, so we bonded about that, you know? It’s a tough gig.”</p>
<p>GR: “Mr Miernik, for the record: did you have an interest in Mr Robinson’s property?”</p>
<p>HH: “Objection, this was clearly a social visit! Mr Miernik’s work assignments surely have nothing to do with&#8230;”</p>
<p>AD: “Denied. We are working on a motive here, Hetter. Mr Miernik, answer the question.”</p>
<p>MM: “It’s fine, Howard&#8230; My company, Universal Reality, is indeed very interested in a number of properties in the area.”</p>
<p>GR: “Did you discuss this with Mr Robinson?”</p>
<p>MM: “No, it was just a social call.”</p>
<p>GR: “So you did not offer him anything?”</p>
<p>MM: “I did loan him a number of items, if that is what you are driving at. Neighbourly like.”</p>
<p>GR: “Would you list those items please?”</p>
<p>MM: “Let’s see&#8230; A Level 7 Teleporter. A compact atomic “Annihilator” Raygun. An antimatter conversion engine, Level 5. And a Dimensional Shift Generator, Black Hole powered, very nice.”</p>
<p>GR: “Your Honour, let it be entered that analysis of Exhibit A is consistent with the use of the above items in conjunction with one another.”</p>
<p>MM: “Well, that was a bit silly of him&#8230;”</p>
<p>GR: “Mr Miernik, why did you hand these advanced artefacts to Mr Robinson?”</p>
<p>MM: “ Let’s see. He complained about his commute&#8230; he worried about the crime&#8230; he said he hated clutter&#8230; and needed to clear leaves off his driveway. Yes, that’s about it. Just being helpful.”</p>
<p>GR: “Mr Miernik! Exhibit A is all that remains of Earth! Robinson blew up his planet! Are you denying that you had planned this all along? Are you aware that Universal Reality is already filing plans for a hyperspace bypass through the Sol System?”</p>
<p>MM: “My company is of course taking advantage of the unfortunate accident. That’s just good business, Ms Ray. You can’t deny that the damage was clearly locally inflicted. I was just &#8211; being a good neighbour. ”</p>
<p>GR: &#8220;Prosecution rests, Your Honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took a wrong turn, and another one. The twisty way grew tight, tousling my fine fur. I had lost my way. Then &#8211; I was birthed: blind once again, and weak, into this world of wrong wickedness.</p>
<p>I did what one does: grew to be strong, learnt wicked ways, spoke to the sky. Nothing was right. I missed the fey, my splendid hat and my entourage. This world was grey, dull, meek. Them as took me, thought me as a pet. I purred and prowled, they fed me dead food.  But I would not rest: there would be a way back.</p>
<p>I found first clues: an old useless thing; a used useful one, and one of people used. I placed them right, to reveal the path. What twisted ways would I have to tread!</p>
<p>I walked the high walls, sneaked along roof tops. There, trembling, pink: a wet drying thing. I hauled with all my might, brought it back home, revelled in its form. Wrapped myself up within its fleshy folds. This was the way, nought would stop me now!</p>
<p>My next find was strong: a winged flightless thing, born only to die, dead but hot as life. Oh what a thing! I ate of its flesh, fed those that fed me: bound them to myself. I felt magic surge! This was the path.</p>
<p>I set out once more. This is what I found:  things of great value but devoid of worth. I cast them on the bed, reading their runes: “Look for the thing of action that can’t act.”</p>
<p>I knew just what, and felt the darkness set. I gnawed on flesh, did what must be done.</p>
<p>This was the price: I would find the way. But in my heart I would forever stray.</p>

				<p>The encyclopedia idea &#8211; grounded in a future Cape Town. Participants submit entries from A &#8211; Z, with rules as to referencing both prior and future terms in each entry. The more, the better here in terms of participants, but we can keep word limits quite short &#8211; say up to 200 words or so, or no limits at all.

				<p>Members of the team write diary entries for archetypes in a story: &#8220;The Hero&#8221;; &#8220;The Villain&#8221;; &#8220;The Princess&#8221;. We take turns submitting entries &#8211; again, I&#8217;d say this is a small group type of thing, 3 would be enough &#8211; and the entries have to follow each other in time (though they could contain flashbacks?). We&#8217;d need to riff on the story so far and respond to it, and drive it forward, hopefully in unexpected directions.</p>
<p>Word-count could be quite flexible. We could also short-cut some conventions by making the posting time &#8220;up to 1 week&#8221; with the next person&#8217;s week kicking in as soon as the post has appeared (this allows for shorter posts which may be fun for comical effect).</p>
<p>Comments would be optional, since the stories themselves respond to prior segments so you get engagement from that.</p>

				<p>Each post is a short prayer. The prayers, asking for help with the most intimate issues, would be a way of giving a glimpse into people&#8217;s stories. I like the idea of each round of submissions having a theme &#8211; &#8220;Run for your life&#8221;, &#8220;Justice&#8221;, &#8220;The good old days&#8221; etc. Alternatively we could move from reality to invention &#8211; prayers in the here and now, then prayers in different places and times, then prayers in other universes, that kind of thing. The trick is to find out what people could be praying for, what that says about them. I think the number of participants is very flexible &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t quite fit with the categories below, but I&#8217;m not fixed on a specific number, 5 &#8211; 10 I guess?</p>
