It’s probably more than I could afford anyway. Me? Postman. Delivering the mail. See: I’ve the bag and everything.

“Jesus, make it quick, will you?”<br />
“Hi. I’m afraid this coffee’s no good. Here, pick it up. See? Cold. Too cold. You can hold the cup for more than a few seconds. That means it’s too cold. Bring me a hot one, won’t you? There’s a good chap. Let’s see how he does this time.”<br />

				<p>That was the day it happened.</p>
<p>“Superpowers” they called it. Like everyone was suddenly flying or had x-ray vision. But it wasn’t like that: it was mostly small, strange things.</p>
<p>My buddy Mike gained an incredible sense of smell. Could tell you where you’d been days ago. But the power only worked one day a week. My old lady’s left arm became fireproof. Just the arm, just the left.<br />
I was sitting waiting in Grand Central one day. She was late, as usual. I looked down at my watch, then up at the station clock: 11.24. I’d been there almost an hour. I stared down at my watch again, sighed. My eyes widened as I followed the hands of my watch slow down, then wind backwards, then stop at 11.05. I looked back up at the station clock: 11.24.</p>
<p>&sect;</p>
<p>In the morning I tried again. My watch was on the breakfast counter. I concentrated on it, hard, and saw it slow. A fly took off from a dirty plate in the sink and flew across my face. As it crossed over my watch it slowed down, then stopped: it suspended in the air. I concentrated harder, and the hands started turning back. The fly moved backwards along its flight path. About ten centimetres out it suddenly burst from the bubble, sped up, shot away on another trajectory.</p>
<p>&sect;</p>
<p>Before I knew it I’d jumped back to the day we all got our powers. Then three days before. Then a fortnight. Then a year. Then more. Then I knew I’d lost control of it.<br />
And now I’m scratching this into a cave wall with an arrow head. And then I feel the familiar tingle, and I know I’m about to go again.</p>

				<p>I was in a bad mood that day. Worse than usual, I mean. I had been there on my own for what felt like decades. It&#8217;s always hard to tell the exact passing of time when you&#8217;re inside, isn&#8217;t it? It feels like that edge between being asleep and awake: not quite on either side.<br />
I understanded that I needed to be punished. I deserved a less spacious cage. But at least when I was in a lamp I was moving around in the world quite a lot. And sometimes you can sense other Djinn nearby. You ever get that? Like a tingling in your fingertips. If you were corporeal, I mean.</p>
<p>Where was  I? Ah, yes: bad mood. I needed to grant some wishes. I was feeling rough around the edges. Bad comedown. Then I sensed him. A bit flat and flavourless maybe, but better than nothing. He must have been quite determind: once I was out, I could see that the weather was rough. Gale force winds, rain hammering down. But, he made it to the door of my lighthouse. He didn&#8217;t even try to peer through the porthole, just peeled off a glove and rubbed at it.</p>
<p>I welcomed the familiar sting of it as I twisted and turned my way into the flesh that had formed itself up from the stone and moss. I have a theory about the bodies we use, by the way. Something to do with spare wishes, balancing of energies from retractions, things like that. Later, though. More details later. I opened the door to my bland friend.</p>
<p>He stared at me. Looked me up and down.<br />
&#8220;Three, correct? Anything I want?&#8221;<br />
It had been a long time since I&#8217;d had one of those. Usually I needed to do some parlour tricks as a convincer.<br />
&#8220;Aye.&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Three.&#8221; I lit my pipe.</p>
<p>I played the old one, two, switch on him. No surprises for the first two. He got what he asked for. Got him feeling comfortable for the last big wish. The finale. The blockbuster.<br />
&#8220;I want to be connected. I want to feel connected. To the world.&#8221;<br />
I nodded and told him to close his eyes. Completely unnecessary of course, but I like to keep the showmanship going. I licked my thumb and pushed it gently against his forehead. The air crackled with static as I broke his body down into bits and bytes. I pushed his conciousness into the Internet, into telephone networks.<br />
I left him feel every cut of data being chopped into packets. I let him feel the crunch of the data colliding at the end of each journey. I let him feel the stretch of being pulled half way around the world, then back again.</p>
<p>I just had time for a quick chuckle and a glance up at the Fresnel lens before I stung out of the flesh, back to the aether.</p>

The small <a href="">drawing-room<span>The strongest memory I have of the drawing room is the smell.<br />
There was a salty sea-like smell, almost a taste. The nearest piece of coastline was more than 60 miles away. The smell began tickling your nostrils a few paces away from the door. Once you entered the room, it became almost sweet. Like the smell of meat just before it turns. The strangest thing was that the smell would stay with my shoes for days afterwards.</span></a> was exquisitely neat and smelled of burnt lavender.  There were some <a href="">Dresden shepherds and shepherdesses<span>They were somewhat cracked and crumbled, much like the host.The two figures shared three hands between them and the legs of the bases were broken: they listed towards each other like drunkards on a street corner on a Saturday night.</span></a>, on the <a href="">mantelpiece<span>If I hadn&#8217;t had to sit through hours of his blathering about it before he had it installed, I would have sworn that the mantelpiece was made of lino. Bargain bin cast offs at that. As it was, I knew that he&#8217;d paid through the nose to have it imported from Balochistan. The stone itself wasn&#8217;t cheap, but the bribes for the Customs officials to turn a blind eye to the boys he was smuggling in with the stone had nearly bankrupted him. &#8220;Worth every penny,&#8221; he had leered at me over a glass of port one night.</span></a>, simpering sweetly. There were <a href="">framed water-colours<span>The frames at least matched the elegance of the furniture: rich, smooth, wood; crisp lines. The paintings themselves were a different story. The scenes depicted were easily recognisable as various views from the gardens because the house itself was so striking. The technique left something to be desired, however. The flat washes were heavy-handed and the wet in wet looked more like accidents than artistic endeavour.</span></a>, <a href="">two samplers<span>&#8220;ABCDEFGHIJKL<br />

How&#8230; unimaginative.</span></a>, and <a href="">three needlework pictures<span>The most polite way to describe the content of the pictures would be &#8220;unconventional.&#8221; At first glance they seemed innocent enough, but perhaps haphazardly made. Closer inspection revealed something perhaps more sinister: occult symbols and iconography. I never dared to ask directly if the pictures were their equivalent of a crucifix, for fear of a direct answer.</span></a> on the wall. There were some <a href="">photographs<span>Seventeen. The number of photos he had of his niece and two nephews was now seventeen. The first few that went up felt like he was just the proud uncle. After the tenth one found its place on the the wall it started to become a little odd. Then he started making ever more elaborate frames for them: card; tissue paper; buttons; glitter.I suppose that&#8217;s why he was always hanging around Mrs Williams&#8217; haberdashery as a boy.</span></a> of what were obviously nephews and nieces and some good furniture – a <a href="">Chippendale desk<span>The desk was exquisite: a thing of beauty. It was one of the few things in the house that I coveted. While so many other things were in a state of disrepair (the curtains, the Afghans), he kept the desk in the most mint of conditions. I would have loved to have a rummage around in his drawers, but he never left it unattended. It was almost as if he was frightened it would run off if it looked around and realised where it was.</span></a>, some little <a href="">satin-wood tables<span>The tables were of such a high quality and craftsmanship that the knitted coasters splayed upon them jarred all the more. The surfaces were often slightly sticky to the touch, as though they&#8217;d been cleaned in a hurry upon hearing the door bell.</span></a> – and a hideous and rather uncomfortable <a href="">Victorian sofa<span>I chose to remain standing rather than sit on the sofa. It&#8217;s not so much the uncomfortableness of it, more that dark patch at one end. Who knows what it is, or how long it&#8217;s been there. Are those <em>claw </em>marks in the wood? My goodness.<br />

				<p>The most polite way to describe the content of the pictures would be &#8220;unconventional.&#8221;<br />
At first glance they seemed innocent enough, but perhaps haphazardly made.<br />
Closer inspection revealed something perhaps more sinister: occult symbols and iconography.<br />
I never dared to ask directly if the pictures were their equivalent of a crucifix, for fear of a direct answer.</p>

				<p>The desk was exquisite: a thing of beauty. It was one of the few things in the house that I coveted.<br />
While so many other things were in a state of disrepair (the curtains, the Afghans), he kept the desk in the most mint of conditions.<br />
I would have loved to have a rummage around in his drawers, but he never left it unattended. It was almost as if he was frightened it would run off if it looked around and realised where it was.</p>

				<p>I chose to remain standing rather than sit on the sofa. It&#8217;s not so much the uncomfortableness of it, more that dark patch at one end. Who knows what it is, or how long it&#8217;s been there.<br />
Are those <em>claw </em>marks in the wood? My goodness.</p>
