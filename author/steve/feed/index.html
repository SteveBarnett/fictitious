				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I open my eyes and it feels different. It feels dreamy. When I try and concentrate, I realise that I don&#8217;t remember how it felt before. But I think it was sharper. I think  it feels softer now. More relaxed. Slower.</p>
<p>I try to stand up, but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I try to move my legs, but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I look down at my hands, crossed on my lap, and see a tiny dial. Like a timer on an old rehydrator. The arrow points to red. Red what? It has two more notches: green and blue. Green and blue what? I turn the dial one notch to green.</p>
<p>I try to scream, but I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I taste metal. I feel suddenly cold. I can see the edges of the room now, but I wish I couldn&#8217;t. The walls glitch and distort. I feel like I&#8217;m going to vomit. I look down at my wrist to turn the dial, but it&#8217;s gone. It was right there.</p>
<p>I look up at the ceiling, hoping for a calmer sight than the walls, but it&#8217;s worse. It&#8217;s cracked and melted and shattered, and it oozes slowly towards me. I turn my head away and see the dial. My other hand. How did it move? I crank the dial to blue.</p>
<p>Clear.<br />
Crystal.<br />
Light.</p>
<p>I feel at peace.<br />
Everything starts to desaturate, to darken.<br />
But I feel at peace, and I welcome it.</p>
<p>Colour to grey to black.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chairs standing empty<br />
Scratch marks on the wooden floor<br />
A discarded broom</p>
<p>A narrative in objects:<br />
Chairs, marks, broom and the oak chest.</p>
<p>The lock lays broken<br />
Pieces of it scattered wide<br />
The chest&#8217;s lid open</p>
<p>Within a velvet cushion,<br />
A dent where something had lain.</p>
<p>The air inside glows.<br />
A residue from the theft,<br />
A trail to follow.</p>
<p>Three had kept vigil this night.<br />
Which would dare such sacrilege.</p>
<p>Down the corridor:<br />
Leathered soles against stone slabs.<br />
Quickly receding.</p>
<p>Sounds follow the trail of light,<br />
One fleeing, two pursuing.</p>
<p>The pursuers shout.<br />
The thief wisely saves their breath,<br />
gaining, inch by inch.</p>
<p>Heretic, thief, traitor, betrayer.<br />
One who would defy the gods.</p>
<p>High up, the bells toll.<br />
The thief curses, picks up speed.<br />
Bells mean constables.</p>
<p>Outside all is confusion.<br />
Narrow streets echo alarm.</p>
<p>They round the corner.<br />
Arms and blades fly. The thief falls.<br />
The new owner runs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally ready,<br />
She takes her hands off her eyes,<br />
And stands up, stand tall.</p>
<p>Her black silk shirt is weightless;<br />
the floor, cold beneath bare feet</p>
<p>the stone is worn smooth and sleek,<br />
but splinters stick to her sole</p>
<p>She walks with full confidence,<br />
Hiding the consuming fear.</p>
<p>By the oak tree stump<br />
An axe is being sharpened</p>
<p>Made for her light build,<br />
Designed to be swung just once.</p>
<p>The sacrifice sits<br />
Bound, gagged, blindfolded, waiting.<br />
It stirs, tries to speak.</p>
<p>Horror consumes her<br />
as she sees the victim&#8217;s face.<br />
Inhuman. Strange. Wrong.</p>
<p>Features swim around its face,<br />
Shimmer like sun on water<br />
She must to kill it.</p>
<p>Something deep within call out:<br />
Erase this wrongness.</p>
<p>Fingers wrap around the axe.<br />
She swings it, testing its weight.<br />
She feels it in her:</p>
<p>The human urge to murder,<br />
To kill the unknown.</p>
<p>She takes short, quick, steps forward.<br />
She raises the axe up high.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I prime the musket before I round the corner, just to be prudent. Caskets and bales of hay. As expected. But no guards. That is not as expected. I can hear the constables patrolling a few streets away, so I cross the cobbles at a fair clip, keeping myself low to the ground, and to the shadows.</p>
<p>The solid oak door leading into the tavern stands ajar. I glance around behind me before slipping through the gap and into the warm glow cast by the oil lamps.</p>
<p>In the middle of the room is a single table. A solitary pigskin purse sits on it, looking heavy with its fill. I pick it up, open the drawstrings, and peer inside. Some manner of dust, black in colour. I sniff it, trying to catch its smell, and immediately my eyes water and my head spins. Darkness closes in quickly from all sides.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I slide a fresh clip into the 9, clear the chamber. I eyeball around the corner. Couple of boxes and bin bags, but no security. Thought there would at least be a rent-a-cop doing rounds. Sirens bounce off the concrete and around a few corners towards me, so I sneak across the street away from them.</p>
<p>The edges of the security gate are bent and bashed. The lock sits in pieces of the ground. I shoot a glance behind me, then head into the room with the cold blue bulbs.</p>
<p>A green plastic box sits on a brushed steel table. I open the box. It&#8217;s filled with black dust. I lick a finger, dip it in, and try a taste. Wow. That&#8217;s… I feel a blackout coming on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bang, bang, bang on the door.</p>
<p>You ignore it. You have work to do. You grab a fresh bottle of disinfectant and pop the top off with one hand, in a fluid, practised motion. You pour a few centimetres of it into the tray and rinse your tools.</p>
<p>Eyes shut, they said. Shut! Why would you want them to be shut? Some people just don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Your bearers bring the sacrifice in. Six of them, the boy resting on their shoulders. They walk slowly along the central aisle, steps perfectly in sync, as you have taught them. They complained about the hours of training, but now they must understand. The beauty of the ceremony would be diminished without this precision.</p>
<p>The family and friends watch as their loved one makes the final part of the journey to an everlasting life. The bearers position him as tradition demands. But with eyes open. So that the mourners can see into his soul. So that he, even in his paralysed state, can see them.</p>
<p>The father cries, of course. He argued most fervently for eyes closed. You won&#8217;t let a grieving father&#8217;s wishes get in the way of his son&#8217;s salvation, though.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bang, bang, bang on the door.</p>
<p>What can you tell him? That you saved his son, when he could not? That you had the courage, when he did not? No. He is still a grieving father and he does not need to hear these things. You will do as you must. You will take his insults and his threats. You will sleep soundly knowing that you have helped another soul along their path.</p>
<p>Bang, bang, bang on the door.</p>
<p>You rise from your desk and go to the door.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve managed to fashion a crude quill using a feather from one of the beasts. Its mane is spread and spiky, and its call sends chills down my spine. But when it sleeps, it sleeps deep. I broke its neck quickly, silently, and pulled it back to my cave before I was spotted. The meat did not agree with me.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>3rd June</strong></p>
<p>Sectors 1, 2, and 4 report nothing unusual.<br />
Sector 3 reports loss of another peacock. Three replacements ordered: two peacocks and one gameskeeper. Usual severance package supplied.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>Day 12</strong></p>
<p>I try to sleep when the burning ball comes out, but it&#8217;s becoming dangerous. The monkeys prowl around, poking at things. Poking at my things.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like the way they move. All jittery and stuttery. I will take one down before the end of this cycle. I will kill it and post it as a warning for the others.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>June 15th</strong></p>
<p>Sectors 1, 2, and 4 report nothing unusual.<br />
Sector 3 reports loss of more wildlife. Fire broke out on Tuesday, contained by rapid response.<br />
Oh, and three rangers found dead, skinned, and hung from trees.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>Day 24</strong></p>
<p>Too many. I ate too many. Mushrooms and meat and leaves and flowers that sting. I seem to be leaking, and I can&#8217;t make it stop.</p>
<p>&#8258;</p>
<p><strong>July 7th</strong></p>
<p>Sectors 1 and 4 report nothing unusual.<br />
Sector 2 reports minor damage to some enclosures.<br />
Sector 3 reports discovery of hollowed out tree. Dead body inside. Trunk covered with indecipherable scribble. Three tubs of prescription medication, unopened.<br />
Construction has begun on Sector 5.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I take a last drag on my cigarette, then stub it out on the crumbling brick wall. A working guy across the street gives me a  dirty look. Even in this crappy part of town smoking is frowned upon. At least here it&#8217;s not illegal like it is uptown. Can&#8217;t have people smoking outside banks and schools, apparently.</p>
<p>I shrug my knapsack up higher on my shoulder, start walking from shadow to shadow towards my destination. Don&#8217;t want to attract any unwanted attention. Especially not when I&#8217;m carrying this much.</p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s the night. A game this big is usually too high stakes for me. But a friend got me in the door, as long as I could put up the currency. So I scraped it together.</p>
<p>I knock on the door. A peep hole slides open. I get a look, a squint, then a nod. The hole slides shut, and the door slides open. She thumbs at the corridor, points with her eyes. I take a few strides down and there&#8217;s another door. The floor&#8217;s kinda slimy.</p>
<p>I look back down the corridor at the bouncer. I point at the door, raise my eyebrows. She nods. I open the door.</p>
<p>The three others are already here, sitting around the poker table. They look at me like I don&#8217;t belong here. I don&#8217;t. I know it. But I&#8217;m not going to let that stop me. I pull my knapsack off my shoulder, put it down on the table. I reach in, pull out the currency, slam it down on the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three squid.&#8221; They start squirming. &#8220;Now how about we play some poker?&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time they&#8217;ll let me in. This time I&#8217;ll cut the mustard.<br />
I stride confidently up to the huge, heavy, wooden doors and thrust my hand out at the doorman.<br />
&#8220;Jackson,&#8221; I say, smiling, but not beaming. &#8220;Ralph Jackson. I&#8217;m here for the event.&#8221;<br />
The doorman looks at my hand like it&#8217;s something he&#8217;s scraped off his shoe.<br />
&#8220;Yes. Well.&#8221; He taps at his data pad and flicks up and down the list. &#8220;I&#8217;m… sorry, Mr Jackson, but you don&#8217;t appear to be on the list.&#8221;<br />
I give him my best scowl and stride off before he can strip any more of my dignity from me. Maybe I can try the back door.<br />
I try and stroll casually around the back of the building. I catch a whiff of garlic: kitchens must be this way. I find a door that&#8217;s ajar and creep up to it. I swing it open, and the doorman is standing there, waiting for me.<br />
&#8220;Can I help you, sir?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;How did you…? Never mind.&#8221;  I run off around the corner, cursing under my breath. &#8220;Dammit!&#8221; I punch the wall. Hmm, soft.<br />
Vines run up from the ground to the top of the building. I give them a firm pull: they seem pretty sturdy. I scramble my way up to the first floor. No doorman.<br />
The curtains are drawn.<br />
The door is unlocked, and opens smoothly.<br />
I pull back the curtains and discover the secret they&#8217;ve been hiding from me for all these months. I scream and scream until I go hoarse and my eyes water. Then I turn and run and dive off the balcony.</p>
