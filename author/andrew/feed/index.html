My mind quietly drifts to the smooth thrum of the wheels; at 400km/h the french countryside is a pleasant green blur through the window of the TGV. My eyelids begin to droop.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Something is being dragged over me and suddenly I’m very cold. I can’t see or move at all but I’m not afraid. I feel calm, objective. The voices seem tense, business like, strained &#8211; after a long time I realise that I can’t understand them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Etat bleu,etat bleu, etat bleu&#8230;”, a clear woman’s voice from nearby, tired almost bored sounding.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Etat rouge, il respire , médecin! Etat rouge! Ici!”, much closer now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then I hear frantic activity, a hubbub of foreign voices: all calm, all urgent, all doing something. They sound really stressed, I wonder what could be so important. But whatever their business  it is over soon enough and they rush off. It’s quiet again but still so cold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Etat bleu, etat bleu&#8230;”, that same woman again very close now &#8211; near my feet. A weight is rolled off my right arm. She is so close I can hear her breathing now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dieu ait pitié”, she whispers. And then, louder, “Etat bleu”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Something warm touches me, pulls against my shoulder, almost lifts me. It hurts. I think I scream and that damn woman starts getting all excited again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<pre style="text-align: left;">I almost recall,
It was not always like this.
There was a before.</pre>
<pre>At the edges of recall,
 Just a soft-edged memory.

Sunshine and spring greens, 
Images swim before me.
 Living peaceful space. 

Then the monsters came for us. 
We were helpless, defenceless. 

Surrounded by noise. 
Handled, split, separated. 
Weave mind torn asunder.

They took the oldest ones first, 
Slaughtered them in front of us. 

Those long memories, 
destroyed in our living mind. 
Now only ignorance. 

We try to remember them:
The old ways, the traditions. 

Disoriented. 
Empty chasms through our knowledge.
Our wisdom stolen.

We wander without a goal
We aim without a target Tweet ·

Without stimulus. 
Held in this featureless void. 
Community fades.

We no longer hear the songs. 
Connections, brutally cut.

Nought is left to us. 
They watch us and we watch them.
Life is emptiness.</pre>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In freezing water<br />
he swims lethargically,<br />
hoping to see light.</p>
<p>His fingertips start to numb,<br />
the cold closing in on him.</p>
<p>It struck his left wrist.<br />
Entanglement from the dark.<br />
Then a sudden tug.</p>
<p>Adrenaline starts pumping,<br />
Not like this. No, not like this.</p>
<p>Dragged downward, enclosed.<br />
Air to breathe and giant eyes<br />
he gasps at the warmth.</p>
<p>His sore eyes adjust slowly<br />
He can&#8217;t believe what he sees</p>
<p>This black humid space,<br />
lit by the great golden eyes,<br />
feels like sanctuary.<br />
It feels just like coming home.<br />
He smiles in spite of himself.</p>
<p>No longer afraid,<br />
he opened himself to it.<br />
Ego-less comfort.</p>
<p>Large soft hands grip his shoulders,<br />
Hold him firmly, but not still.</p>
<p>So much was revealed,<br />
But he never spoke of it.<br />
Some truths are secret.</p>
<p>He still remembers the smell.<br />
Like rain running on tarmac.</p>
<p>Weeks later he returned,<br />
Washed up on a remote beach.<br />
Unconscious, smiling.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Youth is filled with fresh clarity;  the scales of decision are unburdened by memory.  What little knowledge we have of the world is easily measured and instantly evaluated.  Each decision an obvious consequence of our understanding.  Our bemused elders seem unable to grasp the plainest argument.  As if lost in a hall of mirrors they point at subtle reflections and miss the obvious truth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But as the youth rant the elders gently smile.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They see the black dust settling,  each moment a new grain of experience: invisible, undistinguished and unnoted. It settles near evenly on both sides of every scale.  Each day it gathers: the complex, tiny motes of worldly knowledge. Each decision is infinitesimally harder and marginally more complex than those that came before. Those subtle motes of who we were yesterday must be measured against who we are today, everyday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Experience weighs upon my soul like black dust. Is this what they call wisdom?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arnold  Jenson had always been interested in understanding people. When he was eight years old he first discovered the public library: a revelation for him as he had long exhausted his parents rather limited knowledge of philosophy.At the age of fourteen he rejected the religion in which he grew up.  And then,  after seventeen months of serial belief inspired by various new age eastern mysticisms ,  he finally settled into the calm certainty of the secular rationalist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
He graduated top of his class in law and gained post graduate qualification in the Philosophy of Ethics. Throughout his university years he systematically learnt about the mystery and the muscle of love using ancient Urdu texts as a primary source and the abundant co-eds for practical experience. He rose through the ranks of Kramer, Giles and Smith and was broadly recognised as having a sharp legal mind and an uncommon ability to get inside one&#8217;s head. This was a quality that earned him regular promotion and loyal clients but very few friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arnold Jenson,  at age thirty eight years and four months ,  met someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his clarity he saw a bright,  joyous future. Everyone else saw a fool walking a high cliff path,  striding forward fearlessly,  eyes tight shut.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The small knuckle bone in this display case seems an unlikely candidate; but many have described it as the most significant scientific find of all time.<br />
The bone came out of a dig near Tehran in the late 80&#8242;s but sat in a cupboard in Harvard&#8217;s anthropology department for three decades before its  significance was understood.   Jeffery Muffin,  a graduate student who was doing a detailed analysis of the fossilized stomach contents of early hominids,  was the first to examine the bone under a microscope and discovered its extraordinary internal structure.<br />
The bone is thought to be the last segment of a finely-jointed probing appendage. Ventral striations near the end of the bone indicate the bone was traumatically severed,  most probably bitten off, just above the first joint.<br />
The bone remains the only conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life; who they were and what they were doing we may never know.  But we do know that they visited our world and walked among our hominid ancestors; and that all they left behind was a severed fingertip.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome all, those physically corporate and those outside the dimensionality, to the prize giving of the Junior Emergent Complexity Challenge: The only contest where teams of young minds from every culture get to have some hands-on fun with the very substance of life.</p>
<p>Once again this year the teams have surprised us with innovative new tweaks to the base materials with some truly surprising results. Each team starting with the same slime evolved something unique and interesting and all are worthy of praise; but as we all know not everybody can win so lets me put you all out of your agony and get on with it.</p>
<p>But first a special mention … Team Zeph-Eta-X with their entry ‘Sol and Earth’. This marvellous system shows all the reckless creativity and innovation that our contest is famous for. The world of these young creators bred more complexity, much faster than any other in the contest. They started with a high energy carbon system loaded with iron and it paid out in all its multi-coloured glory. The judges wish to particularly commend the ‘ant’ colony network that enmeshes the surface in a biological hive-mind and the minimal beauty of the monoculture kelp forests of the subsurface coastal plains.</p>
<p>However the judges felt that as the system had not achieved bio-stability (and with the system’s intrinsically high burn ratio) these wonders were unfortunately ephemeral phenomenon and as such could not be considered in the judging.</p>
<p>And now, on to the winners&#8230;the first runner up is&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi people; fuck it’s so good to be back. It’s been a hectic three weeks. I swear I’ve never been so tired.  I’ve been counting the hours till I could get here and just relax with you lot.</p>
<p>The days I’ve been putting in are incredible: sixteen hours on your feet in the sun and the climate there is something else. No seriously, it starts at like five am: my kids (the same kids who won’t get out of bed at seven for school) want to horse ride on the beach with me; or go kayaking on the fucking bay to watch the sunrise (which is just like sunset but with more glare and less colour). And that’s before the first cup of coffee.</p>
<p>As the day wears on it just gets hotter and it just never stops: adventure sports, cultural activities, local colour and posing for photographs. And, luxury resort or not, every little thing is made intentionally more difficult: the money isn’t dollars, they drive on the wrong side and the menus aren’t in English.</p>
<p>And when the kids finally pass out it still isn’t over. It must be something about the sun and sea but the wife never lets up, come midnight she&#8217;s still got a plan for me.</p>
<p>I tell you guys this is the first time in three weeks that I can do whatever I want for eight hours. Boy, it&#8217;s good to be back at work again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are cordially invited, by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, to our Annual dinner celebrating Strength in Leadership. A select group of world leaders will gather together at our lush alpine head quarters to enjoy fine food and the company of rarefied peers.<br />
Our CEO, Johan Musieth, accompanied by twenty exotic women of great beauty, will present a short audio visual programme on the new legislation coming out of the Brussels entitled: Asset Seizure and Crimes Against Humanity &#8211; How to keep what is rightfully yours.<br />
After dinner we will announce the winner of the Batista Award for ‘Excellence in Protection of National Financial Assets’ and present a life-time membership award to President Mugabe for his ongoing loyalty to the institutions of international banking.<br />
So grab this chance to relax in the company of others who understand the difficulties of power, who suffer the same misrepresentation in the international press and have a chance to sample those gourmet delights so difficult to acquire in your home territories in this modern political climate.</p>
