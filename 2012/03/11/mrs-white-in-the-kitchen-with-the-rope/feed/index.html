		<description><![CDATA[Hello! This is a very cool idea, bringing in all the messy voodoo stuff into the English kitchen.  I would suggest you try setting it in present tense, however - the dialogue is so immediate that it is not clear if the past tense is used because Mother Nastri is dead, or because the story is told in past tense.

I enjoyed the rawness and juxtaposition of images, but was a bit bothered by some of the punctuation, spelling and phrasing.

&gt; “...Please come in it’s nice to meet you in person. “
Definitely a comma, or even a full stop, after &quot;come in&quot;. There needs to be a pause.

&gt;“... for the dogs” 
It looks a bit naked without the customary comma, or even a full stop. &quot;... for the dogs.&quot;

&gt; – boiled down chicken blood doesn’t smell like tripe but Mrs Peirson wouldn’t know that.
Again, comma before but.

&gt;“You say cloves? And cinnamon? Well it is a kitchen…” 
I would recommend comma after well, or emphasis on IS for a different sentence flow. &quot;Well, it is a kitchen...&quot; or &quot;Well it IS a kitchen...&quot; (sounds a bit more colloquial but still works ok.)

&gt; – scorched bat fur smells nothing like cloves! 
That sentence is a bit awkward - the repetition of cloves is perhaps unnecessary. &quot;That would be the scorched bat fur, I suspect.&quot; or something like that works better.

&gt;Mother Nastri would have cackled wildly at that:  She was quietly [don&#039;t need the &quot;quietly&quot;, it does not fit in with how she speaks] proud of the strange reeks that issued from her quarters behind the main house. [this is where i would suggest present tense, for example.] In those long forgotten years in Haiti such stenches advertised her power and artifice. [this reference is a bit confusing - it needs contextualising, like &quot;but now it&#039;s all tripe and cloves to the English.&quot;

&gt; – it had  better be: I spend 
spent

&gt;blood slick rope 
what does that mean? Is it a type of rope or do you mean &quot;rope slick with blood&quot;?

&gt;I was [&quot;had been&quot;, or keep the was but change the rest to present tense] taught , 

&gt;“...Earl Grey for you dear ...”
Comma before &quot;dear&quot;.

&gt;“My mind-technique is simple – have a look at this rope, run it though your hands, concentrate on it” 
Could try pacing out the instructions with full stops to feel less rushed.

&gt;– a real hangman’s noose, used a decade ago to execute a certain John Muller, not easy to acquire in civilised England.
I&#039;d suggest splitting out the last phrase on its own. &quot;...John Muller. Not easy to acquire...&quot;

&gt;“Oh! I am so sorry Mrs Peirson
Comma before Mrs.

&gt;“But you have the hang of it Mrs Peirson – just remember the mind-technique every night and your pregnancy is assured”
Comma before Mrs, full stop after assured.

What, me? Picky? :)]]></description>
